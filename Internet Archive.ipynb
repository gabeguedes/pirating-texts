      "['I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good \\nfamily, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner \\nof Bremen, who settled first at Hull : he got a good estate \\nby merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at \\nYork ; from whence he had married my mother, whose re- \\nlations were named Eobinson, a very good family in that \\ncountry, and from whom I was called Eobinson Kreutznaer ; \\nbut, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are \\nnow called — nay, we call ourselves, and write our name — \\nCrusoe ; and so my companions always called me. \\n\\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant- \\ncolonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly \\ncommanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed \\nat the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What be- \\ncame of my second brother I never knew, any more than my \\nfather or mother did know what was become of me. \\n\\nBeing the third son of the family, and not bred to any \\ntrade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling \\nthoughts ; my father, who was very ancient, had given me a \\ncompetent share of learning, as far as house education and a \\ncountry free-school generally go, and designed me for the \\n(aw ; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; \\nand my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, \\nnay, the commands of my father, and against all the entreaties \\nand persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there \\nseemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature, \\ntending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me. \\n\\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and ex- \\n\\n\\n\\n10 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ncellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He \\ncalled me one morning into his chamber, where he was con- \\nfined by the gout, and expostulated ve.\\'y warmly with me \\nupon this subject : he asked me what reasons, more than a \\nmere wandering inclination, I had for leaving my father\\'s \\nhouse and my native country, where I might be well intro- \\nduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by appli- \\ncation and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He \\ntold me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of \\naspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad \\nupon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves \\nfamous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road ; \\nthat these things were all either too far above me, or too far \\nbelow me ; that mine was the middle state, or what might be \\ncalled the upper station of low life, which he had found, by \\nlong experience, was the best state in the world, and the \\nmost suited to human happiness ; that the middle station of \\nlife was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind of en- \\njoyments ; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a \\nmiddle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, \\nsociety, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, \\nwere the blessings attending the middle station of life ; that \\nthis way men went silently and smoothly through the world, \\nand comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours \\nof the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for \\ndaily bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances, which \\nrob the soul of peace, and the body of rest. \\n\\nAfter this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affec- \\ntionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate \\nmyself into miseries which nature, and the station of life I \\nwas born in, seemed to have provided against ; that as he \\nwould do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle \\nat home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand \\nin my misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement to go \\naway : and to close all, he told me I had an elder brother for \\nan example, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions \\nto keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could \\nnot prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the \\narmy, where he was killed ; and though he said he would not \\ncease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that \\nif I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 1] \\n\\nshould have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected \\nhis counsel, when there might be none to assist in my re- \\ncovery. \\n\\nI observed in this last part of his discourse, which was \\ntruly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it \\nto be so himself, the tears run down his face very plentifully, \\nespecially when he spoke of my brother who was killed ; and \\nthat when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none \\nto assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the discourse, \\nand told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me. \\n\\nI was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who \\ncould be otherwise ? and I resolved not to think of going \\nabroad any more, but to settle at home according to my \\nfather\\'s desire. But, alas! a few days wore it all off; and, \\nin short, to prevent any of my father\\'s further importunities, \\nin a few weeks after, I resolved to run quite away from him. \\nHowever, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my \\nresolution prompted, but I took my mother, at a time when I \\nthought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told her \\nthat my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the \\nworld, that I should never settle to anything with resolution \\nenough to go through with it, and my father had better give \\nme his consent than force me to go without it ; that I was \\nnow eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice \\nto a trade, or clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure, if I did, \\nI should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run \\naway from my master before my time was out, and go to sea ; \\nand if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage \\nabroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go \\nno more ; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to re- \\ncover the time that I had lost. \\n\\nThis put my mother into a great passion ; she told me she \\nknew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon \\nany such subject ; and that, if I would ruin myself, there was \\nno help for me ; but I might depend I should never have their \\nconsent to it ; and I should never have it to say that my \\nmother was willing when my father was not. \\n\\nThough my mother refused to name it to my father, yet I \\nheard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, \\nand that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said \\nto her, with a sigh, \" That boy might be happy if he would \\n\\n\\n\\n12 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nstay at home ; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most \\nmiserable wretch that ever was born ; I can give no consent \\nto it.\" \\n\\nIt was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, \\nthough, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all \\nproposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulated \\nwith my father and mother about their being so positively de- \\ntermined against what they knew my inclinations prompted \\nme to. But being one day at Hull, whither I went casually, \\nand without any purpose of making an elopement at that \\ntime, and one of my companions going by sea to London in \\nhis father\\'s ship, and prompting me to go with them, with the \\ncommon allurement of a seafaring man, that it should cost me \\nnothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother \\nany more, nor so much as sent them word of it ; but leaving \\nthem to hear of it as they might, without asking God\\'s bless- \\ning or my father\\'s, without any consideration of circumstances \\nor consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 1st of \\nSeptember, 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London. \\nThe ship was no sooner got out of the Humber, than the wind \\nbegan to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner ; \\nand, as I had never been at sea before, I was most inex- \\npressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind. I began now \\nseriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I \\nwas overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked \\nleaving rr\\\\y father\\'s house, and abandoning my duty. \\n\\nAll thi i while the storm increased, and the sea went very \\nhigh, 1L0 igh nothing like what I have seen many times since; \\nno, nor what I saw a few days after ; but it was enough to \\naffect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never \\nknown anything of the matter. I expected every wave would \\nhave swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, \\nas I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we \\nshould never rise more : in this agony of mind, I made many \\nvows and resolutions, that if it would please God to spare my \\nlife in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry \\nland again, I would go directly home to my father, and never \\nset it into a ship again while I lived. \\n\\nThese wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the \\nstorm lasted, and indeed some time after ; but the next day \\nthe wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to be a \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 13 \\n\\nlittle inured to it; however, I was very grave for all that day, \\nbeing also a little sea-sick still ; but towards night the weather \\ncleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine \\nevening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear, and \\nrose so the next morning ; and having little or no wind, and \\na smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I \\nthought, the most delightful that ever I saw. \\n\\nI had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea- \\nsick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that \\nwas so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so \\ncalm and so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, lest \\nmy good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had \\nenticed me away, comes to me : \" Well, Bob,\" says he, clap- \\nping me upon the shoulder, \" how do you do after it ? I \\nwarrant you were frighted, wer\\'n\\'t you, last night, when it \\nblew but a capful of wind ?\" — \" A capful, d\\'yc-u call it ?\" \\nsaid I ; \" \\'twas a terrible storm.\" — \" A storm, you fool you,\" \\nreplies he ; \" do you call that a storm ? Why, it was nothing \\nat all ; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think \\nnothing of such a squall of wind as that ; but you\\'re but a \\nfresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, \\nand we\\'ll forget all that ; d\\'ye see what charming weather \\'tis \\nnow 1\" To make short this sad part of my story, we went \\nthe way of all sailors ; the punch was made, and I was made \\nhalf-drunk with it ; and in that one night\\'s wickedness I \\ndrowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past \\nconduct, all my resolutions for the future. As the sea was \\nreturned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by \\nthe abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts \\nbeing over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed \\nup by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my former \\ndesires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that \\nI made in my distress ; and I had, in five or six days, got as \\ncomplete a victory over my conscience as any young fellow \\nthat resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. But I \\nwas to have another trial for it still. \\n\\nThe sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth \\nEoads ; the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, \\nwe had made but little way since the storm. Here we were \\nobliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind con- \\ntinuing contrary, viz., at south-west, for seven or eight days, \\n\\n\\n\\n14 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nduring which time a great many ships from Newcastle came \\ninto the same roads, as the common harbour where the ships \\nmight wait for a wind for the river. \\n\\nWe had not, however, rid here so long, but we should have \\ntided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and, \\nafter we had lain four or five days, blew very hard. How- \\never, the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, the \\nanchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men \\nwere unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, \\nbut spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the \\nsea ; but the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, \\nand we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts, and \\nmake everything snug and close, that the ship might ride as \\neasy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, \\nand our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we \\nthought once or twice our anchor had come home ; upon \\nwhich our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we \\nrode with two anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to \\nthe better end. \\n\\nBy this time it blew a terrible storm indeed ; and now I \\nbegan to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the \\nseamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in the busi- \\nness of preserving the ship, yet, as he went in and out of his \\ncabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say several \\ntimes, \" Lord, be merciful to us ! we shall be all lost ; we \\nshall be all undone I\" and the like. During these first hurries \\nI was lying still in my cabin ; but when the master himself \\ncame by me, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully \\nfrighted. I got up out of my cabin and looked out ; but \\nsuch a dismal sight I never saw : the sea ran mountains high, \\nand broke upon us every three or four minutes ; when I could \\nlook about, I could see nothing but distress round us ; two \\nships that rid near us, we found, had cut their masts by the \\nboard, being deep laden ; and our men cried out, that a ship \\nwhich rid about a mile a-head of us was foundered. Two \\nmore ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of \\nthe road3 to sea, at all adventures, and that not with a mast \\nstanding. The light ships fared the best, as not so much \\nlabouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and \\ncame close by us, running away with only their spritsail out \\nbefore the wind. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 15 \\n\\nTowards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master \\nof our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was \\nvery unwilling to do ; but the boatswain protesting to him, \\nthat if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented; and \\nwhen they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood \\nso loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to \\ncut that away also, and make a clear deck. \\n\\nAny one must judge what a condition I must be in at all \\nthis, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such \\na fright before at but a little. But the worst was not come \\nyet ; the storm continued with such fury, that the seamen \\nthemselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We \\nhad a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in \\nthe sea, so that the seamen every now and then cried out she \\nwould founder. It was my advantage in one respect that I \\ndid not know what they meant by founder, till I inquired. \\nHowever, the storm was so violent, that I saw, what is not \\noften seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more \\nsensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every \\nmoment that the ship would go to the bottom. In the-middle \\nof the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of \\nthe men that had been down to see, cried out we had sprung \\na leak ; another said, there was four feet water in the hold. \\nThen all hands ^ere called to the pump. At that word, my \\nheart, as I thought, died within me ; and I fell backwards \\nupon the side of the bed where I sat, into the cabin. How- \\never, the men roused me, and told me, that I, that was able \\nto do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another ; \\nat which I stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked \\nvery heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing some \\nlight colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged \\nto slip, and run away to the sea, and would come near us, \\nordered a gun to be fired as a signal of distress. I, who \\nknew nothing what they meant, thought the ship had broken, \\nor some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised \\nthat I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when every- \\nbody had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or \\nwhat was become of me ; but another man stepped up to the \\npump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking \\nI had been dead ; and it was a great while before I came to \\nmyself. \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n16 \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nWe worked on ; but the water increasing in the hold, it \\nwas apparent that the ship would founder ; and though the \\nstorm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she \\ncould swim till we might run into any port, so the master \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncontinued firing guns for help ; and a light ship, who had rid \\nit out just a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It \\nwas with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was \\nimpossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near \\nthe ship\\'s side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSOX CIIUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n17 \\n\\n\\n\\nventuring their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope \\nover the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a \\ngreat length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took \\nhold of, and wo hauled them close under our stern, and \"-ot \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPaje 40. \\n\\nall into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after \\nwe were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own ship ; \\nso all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards \\nshore as much as we could ; and our master promised them \\nthat if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make it \\n\\n\\n\\nIS? nouiNsox citusoi:. \\n\\ngood to their master : so partly rowing, and partly driving, \\nour boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the \\nshore almost as far a3 Winterton Ness. \\n\\nWe were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of \\nour ship till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the \\nfirst time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I \\nmust acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the \\nseamen told me she was sinking ; for from the moment that \\nthey rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said to \\ngo in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with \\nfright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what \\nwas yet before me. \\n\\nWhile we were in this condition — the men yet labouring at \\nthe oar to bring the boat near the snore — we could see (when, \\nour boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore) \\na great many people running along the strand to assist us \\nwhen we should come near ; but tve made but slow way to- \\nwards the shore ; nor were we able to reach the shore, till, \\nbeing past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to \\nthe westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a \\nlittle the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and, though \\nnot without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked \\nafterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as «nfortunate men, \\nwe were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates \\nof the town, who assigned ns good quarters, as by particular \\nmerchants and \"owners of ships, and bad money given us \\nsufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we \\nthought fit. \\n\\n^But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that \\nnothing could resist ; and though I had several times loud \\ncalls from my reason, and my more composed judgment, to \\ngo home, yet I had no power to do it. \\n\\nMy comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and \\nwho was the master\\'s son, was now less forward than I. The \\nfirst time ho spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, winch \\n•was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the \\ntown to several quarters, his tone was altered ; and, looking \\nvery melancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I \\ndid ; and, telling\\' his father who I was, and how I had come \\nthis voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther al\\'ivr.-l ; \\nhis father turning to mo, with a very grave and concerned \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 19 \\n\\ntone, \" Young man,\" says lie, \" you ought never to go to sea \\nany more ; you ought to take this for a plain and visible \\ntoken that you are not to be a seafaring man.\" \"Why, sir,\" \\nsaid I, \"will you go to sea no more?\" \"That is another \\ncase,\" said he ; \"it is my colling, and therefore my duty ; but \\nas you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste \\nHeaven has given you of what you are to expect if you \\npersist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on your account, \\nlike Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray,\" continues he, \\n\" what are you ; and on what account did you go -to sea ?\" \\nUpon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which \\nhe burst out into a strange kind of passion. \" What had I \\ndone,\" says he, \"that such an unhappy wretch should come \\ninto my ship ? I would not set my foot in the same ship with \\nthee again for a thousand pounds.\" However, he afterwards \\ntalked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my \\nfather, and not tempt Providence to my ruin ; telling me I \\nmight see a visible hand of Heaven against me. \" And, \\nyoung man,\" said he, \" depend upon it, if you do not go \\nback, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but dis- \\nasters and disappointments, till your father\\'s words are ful- \\nfilled upon you.\" \\n\\nWe parted soon after ; for I made him little answer, and I \\nsaw him no more ; which way he went 1 • knew not. As for \\nme, having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London \\nby land ; and there, as well as on the road, had many strug- \\ngles with myself, what course of life I should take, and whether \\nI should go home or go to sea. \\n\\nAs to going home, shame opposed the best motions that \\noffered to my thoughts ; and it immediately occurred to me \\nhow I should be laughed at among the neighbours, and should \\nbe ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even \\neverybody else. \\n\\nIn this state of life, I remained some time, uncertain what \\nmeasures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irre- \\nsistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed \\nawhile, the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore \\noff; and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires \\nto return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the \\nthoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage. \\n\\nThat evil influence which carried me first away from my \\n\\n\\n\\n20 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nfather\\'s house, whatever it was, presented the most unfor- \\ntunate of all enterprises to my view ; and I went on board a \\nvessel bound to the coast of Africa ; or, as our sailors vul- \\ngarly called it, a voyage to Guinea. \\n\\nIt was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I \\ndid not ship myself as a sailor ; when, though I might indeed \\nhave worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same \\ntime I should have learnt the duty and office of a fore-mast \\nman ; and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or \\nlieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate \\nto choose for the worse, so I did here ; for having money in \\nmy pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would always \\ngo on board in the habit of a gentleman ; and so I neither \\nhad any business in the ship, nor learned to do any. \\n\\nIt was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in \\nLondon. I first got acquainted with the master of a ship who \\nhad been on the coast of Guinea: and who, having had very \\ngood success there, was resolved to go again : this captain \\ntaking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all dis- \\nagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see \\nthe world, told me if I would go the voyage with him I should \\nbe at no expense ; I should be his messmate and his com- \\npanion ; and if I could carry anything with me, I should \\nhave all the advantage of it that the trade would admit ; and \\nperhaps I might meet with some encouragement. \\n\\nI embraced the offer ; and entering into a strict friendship \\nwith this captain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I \\nwent the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure \\nwith me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend \\nthe captain, I increased very considerably ; for I carried about \\n£40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. \\nThis £40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some \\nof my relations whom I corresponded with ; and who, I be- \\nlieve, got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute so \\nmuch as that to my first adventure. \\n\\nThis was the only voyage which I may say was successful; \\nfor I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for \\nmy adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return, \\nalmost £300, and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts \\nwhich have since so completed my ruin. \\n\\nI was now set up for a Guinea trader ; and my friend, to \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 21 \\n\\nmy great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved \\nto go the same voyage again, and I embarked in the same \\nvessel with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and \\nhad now got the command of the ship. This was the unhap- \\npiest voyage that ever man made ; for though I did not carry \\nquite £100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had £200 left, \\nwhich I had lodged with my friend\\'s widow, who was very \\njust to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes ; the first was \\nthis — our ship making her course towards the Canary Islands, \\nor rather between those Islands and the African shore, was \\nsurprised in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover of \\nSallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make. \\nWe crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread, \\nor our masts carry to get clear ; but, finding the pirate gained \\nupon us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, \\nwe prepared to fight ; our ship having twelve guns, and the \\nrogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up \\nwith us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, \\ninstead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight \\nof our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside \\nupon him, which made him sheer off\\' again, after returning \\nour fire, and pouring in also his small shot from near two \\nhundred men which he had on board. However, we had not \\na man touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to \\nattack us again, and we to defend ourselves ; but laying us \\non board the next time upon our other quarter, ho entered \\nsixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting \\nand hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them with small \\nshot, half pikes, powder chests, and such like, and cleared our \\ndeck of them twice ; but our ship being disabled, and three \\nof our men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged to \\nyield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port be- \\nlonging to the Moors. ; \\n\\nThe usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I appre- \\nhended ; I was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper \\nprize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for \\nhis business. At this surprising change of my circumstances, \\nfrom a merchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly over- \\nwhelmed ; and now I looked back upon my father\\'s prophetic \\ndiscourse to me, that I should be miserable and have none to \\nrelieve me, which I thought was now so effectually brought to \\n\\n\\n\\n22 Ronixsox chusoe. \\n\\npass, that I could not be worse; but, alas! this was but a \\ntaste of the misery I was to go through, as will appear in the \\nsequel of this story. \\n\\nAs my master had taken me home to his house, so I was in \\nhopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea \\nagain, believing that it would some time or other be his fate \\nto be taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-of-war ; and that \\nthen I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was \\nsoon taken away ; for when he went to sea, he left me on \\nshore to look after his little garden, and do the common \\ndrudgery of slaves about his house ; and when he came home \\nagain from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to \\nlook after the ship. \\n\\nHero I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method \\nI might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least \\nprobability in it ; so that for two years, though I often pleased \\nmyself with the imagination, yet I never had the least en- \\ncouraging prospect of putting it in practice. \\n\\nAfter about two years, an odd circumstance presented \\nitself, which put the old thought of making some attempt for \\nmy liberty again in my head. My patron lying at home \\nlonger than usual without fitting out his ship, he used, con- \\nstantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather \\nwas fair, to take the ship\\'s pinnace, and go out into the road \\na-fishing ; and, as he always took me and young Maresco with \\nhim to row tha boat, we made him very merry, and I proved \\nvery dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes \\nhe would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the \\nyouth — the Maresco, as they called him, to catch a dish of \\n!;■.!) for him. \\n\\nIt happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morn- \\ning, a fog rose so thick that, though we were not half a league \\nfrom the shore, we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not \\nwhither or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next \\nnight, and when the morning came, we found we had pulled \\noft\\' to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we \\nwere at least two leagues from the shore. However, wo got \\nwell in again, though with a great deal of labour and some \\ndanger. \\n\\nBut our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take \\nmore care of himself for the future; and having lying by him \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 \\n\\nthe long-boat of our English ship that he had taken, he re- \\nsolved he would not go a-fishing any more without a compass \\nand some provision ; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship \\nto build a little state-room, or cabin, in the middle of the \\nlong-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind \\nit to steer, and haul home the main-sheet ; and room before \\nfor a hand or two to stand and work the sails. The cabin \\nlay very snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with \\na slave or two, and a table to eat on, wich some small lockers \\nto put in some bottles of liquor, and his bread, rice, and \\ncoffee. \\n\\nWe went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as I \\nwas most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went with- \\nout me. It happened that he had appointed to go out in this \\nboat with two or three Moors of some distinction in that \\nplace, and for whom he had provided extraordinai\\'ily. and had \\ntherefore sent on board the boat over-night a larger store of \\nprovisions than ordinary ; and had ordered me to get ready \\nthree fusees with powder and shot, which wore on board his \\nship, for that they designed some sport of fowling as well as \\nfishing. \\n\\nI got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the \\nnext morning ; when by-and-by my patron came on board \\nalone, and told me his guests had put off going, from some \\nbusiness that fell out, and ordered me, with the man and boy, \\nas usual, to go out with the boat and catch them some fish, \\nfor that his friends were to sup at his house ; and commanded \\nthat as soon as I o;ot some fish I should brinsf it home to his \\nhouse : all which I prepared to do. \\n\\nThis moment, my former notions of deliverance darted into \\ntnv thoughts, for now I found I was likely to have a little \\nship at my command : and my master being gone, I prepared \\nto furnish myself, not for fishing business, but for a voyage; \\nthough I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whuher \\nT. should steer — anywhere to get out of that place was my \\ndesire. \\n\\nMy first contrivance was to speak to this Moor, to get \\nsomething f Jr our subsistence on board ; so he brought a \\nlarge basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh water, \\ninto the boat. I knew where my patron\\'s case of bottles \\ntsooi.1. and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor \\n\\n\\n\\n24 \\n\\n\\n\\nROEINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nwas on shore, as if they had been there before for our master. \\nI conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which \\nweighed above half a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine \\nor thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which were \\nof great use to us afterwards, especially the wax to make \\ncandles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocently \\ncame into also : his name was Ismael, which they call Muley, \\nOr Moely; so I called to him: — \"Moely,\" said I, \"our \\npatron\\'s guns are on board the boat; can you notget a \\nlittle powder and shot? It may be we may kill some \\nalcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he \\nkeeps the gunner\\'s stores in the ship.\" Accordingly he brought \\na great leather pouch, which held a pound and a half of pow- \\nder, and another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with \\nsome bullets, and put all into the boat. At the same time, I \\nhad found some powder of my master\\'s in the great cabin, \\nwith which I filled one of the large bottles in the case ; and \\nthus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the \\nport to fish*. \\n\\nAfter we had fished some time and caught nothing, for \\nwhen I had fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that \\nhe might not see them, I said to the Moor, \"This will not \\ndo ; our master will not be thus served ; we must stand \\nfarther off.\" He, thinking no harm, agreed, and set the sails ; \\nand, as I had the helm, I run the boat out near a league \\nfarther, and then brought her to ; when, giving the boy the \\nhelm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making \\nas if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by sur- \\nprise with my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear over- \\nboard into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a \\ncork, and begging to be taken in, told me he would go all \\nover the world with me. He swam so strong after the boat, \\nthat he would have reached mo very quickly, upon which I \\nstepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, \\nI presented it at him, and told him I had done him no hurt, \\nand if he would be quiet I would do him none. \" But,\" said \\nI, \" if you come near the boat, I\\'ll shoot you through the \\nhead, for I am resolved to have my liberty ;\" so he turned \\nhimself about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt \\nbut he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer. \\n\\nWhen he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nXury, and said to him, \" Xury, if you will be fuithful to me, \\nI\\'ll make you a great man ; but if you will not stroke your \\nface to be true to me,\" that is, swear by Mahomet and his \\nfather\\'s beard, \" I must throw you into the sea too.\" The \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPago 42. \\n\\nboy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I could \\nnot distrust him, and swore to be faithful to mo, and go all \\nover the world with me. \\n\\nWhile the Moor was swimming, I stood out directly to sea \\nwith the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might \\n\\n\\n\\n2C i;oi;iXaON cgusoe. \\n\\nthink me gone towards the Straits\\' mouth (as indeed anyone \\nthat had been in their wits must have been supposed to. do) ; \\nfor who would have supposed we were sailed on to the south- \\nward, where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround \\nus with their canoes, and destroy us ; where we could not go \\non shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more \\nmerciless savages of human kind? \\n\\nBut as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my \\ncourse, and steered directly south and by east ; and having a \\nfresh gale of wind, and a smooth sea, I made such sail that I \\nbelieve by the next day at three o\\'clock in the afternoon, \\nwhen I first made the laud, I could not be less than one hun- \\ndred and fifty miles south of Sallee. \\n\\nThe wind continued fair till I had sailed in that manner \\nfive days ; and then the wind shifting to the southward, I \\nconcluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, \\nthey would now give over ; so I ventured to make to the \\ncoast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I \\nknew not what, or where ; I neither saw, or desired to see, \\nany people ; the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. \\nWe came into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on \\nshore as soon as it was dark, and discover the country ; but \\nas soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of \\nthe barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we \\nknew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die \\nwith fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day. \\n\"\\'Well, Xury,\" said I, \"then I won\\'t ; but it may be we may see \\nmen by day who will be as bad to us as those lions.\" — \" Then \\nw r e give them the shoot gun,\" says Xury, laughing, \" make \\nthem run wey.\" I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and \\nI gave him a dram to cheer him up ; and we dropped our \\nlittle anchor, and lay still all night ; I say still, for we slept \\nnone ; for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures, \\nof many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the \\nw r ater, wallowing and washing for the pleasure of cooling \\nthemselves ; and they made such hideous howlings and yell- \\nings, that I never indeed heard the like. \\n\\nXury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too ; but \\nwo were both more frighted when we heard one of these \\nmighty creatures come swimming towards our boat; we could \\nnot see him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CKUSOE. 2.1 \\n\\nmonstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, \\nand cried to me to weigh anchor and row away : \"~Ko,\" says \\nI, \" Xury ; we can slip our cable, with the buoy to it, and go \\noff to sea ; they cannot follow us far.\" I had no sooner said \\nso, but I perceived the creature within two oars\\' length ; how- \\never, I immediately fired at him, upon which he turned about, \\nand swam towards the shore again. \\n\\nBut it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hide- \\nous cries and bowlings, that were raised upon the report of \\nthe gun. This convinced me that there was no going on \\nshore for us in the night on that coast, and how to venture on \\nshore in the day was another question too ; for to have fallen \\ninto the hands of any of the savages had been as bad as to \\nhave fallen into the hands of lions and tigers. \\n\\nBe that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some- \\n•where or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the \\nboat. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with one of \\nthe jars, he would find if there was any water, ami bring- \\nsome to me. I asked him why he would go ? The boy \\nanswered with so much affection as made me love him ever \\nafter. \" If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey.\" — • \\n\" Well, Xury,\" said I, \" we will both go, and if the wild \\nmans come, we will kill them, they shall eat neither of \\nus.\" So we hauled the boat in near the shore, and waded \\non shore, carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for \\nwater. \\n\\nI did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the \\ncoming of canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy \\nseeing a low place about a mile up the country, rambled to it, \\nand by-and-by I saw him come running towards me. I \\nthought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with \\nsome wild beast, and I ran forwards to help him ; but when \\nI came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his \\nshoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare ; \\nit was very good meat ; but the great joy that poor Xury \\ncame with, was to tell me he had found good water, and seen \\nno wild mans. \\n\\nBut we found afterwards that we need not take such pains \\nfor water, for a little higher up the creek we found the water \\nfie.:!) when the tide was out, so we filled our jars, and feasted \\non the hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, \\n\\n\\n\\n28 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nhaving seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part \\nof the country. \\n\\nI had no instruments to take an observation to know what \\nlatitude we were in ; but my hope was, that if I stood along \\nthis coast till I came to that part where the English traded, I \\nshould find some of their vessels that would relieve and take \\nus in. \\n\\nWe made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve \\ndays, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to \\nabate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than we \\nwere obliged for fresh water. My design in this was, to make \\nthe Kiver Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, anywhere about \\nthe Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some \\nEuropean ship. \\n\\nWhen I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, \\nI began to see that the land was inhabited ; and, in two or \\nthree places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the \\nshore to look at us ; we could also perceive they were quite \\nblack, and naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore \\nto them ; but Xury said to me, \" No go, no go.\" However, \\nI hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, and I \\nfound they ran along the shore by me a good way : I observed \\nthey had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a \\nlong slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that \\nthey could throw them a great way with good aim ; so I kept \\nat a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I \\ncould ; and particularly made signs for something to eat ; they \\nbeckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me \\nsome meat. Upon this, I lowered the top of my sail, and lay \\nby, and two of them ran up into the country, and in less than \\nhalf an hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of \\ndry flesh and some corn. We were willing to accept it ; but \\nhow to come at it was our next dispute, for I would not ven- \\nture on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us : \\nbut they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the \\nshore and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off \\ntill we fetched it on board, and then came close to us again. \\n\\nWe made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to \\nmake them amends; but an opportunity offered that very in- \\nstant to oblige them wonderfully : for while we were lying \\nby the shore, came two mighty creatures with great fury from \\n\\n\\n\\nKOEINSON CUTJSOE. 29 \\n\\nthe mountains towards the sea. The man that had the lance \\nor dart did not fly from them, but the rest did ; however, as \\ntlie two creatures ran directly into the water, they did not \\noffer to fall upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves \\ninto the sea, and swam about, as if they had come for their \\ndiversion : at last one of them began to come nearer our boat \\nthan at first I expected ; but I lay ready for him, for I had \\nloaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury \\nload both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my \\nreach, I fired, and shot him directly in the head : he imme- \\ndiately made to the shore, but died just before he reached it. \\n\\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor \\ncreatures at the noise and fire of my gun ; some of them \\nwere ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the \\nvery terror ; but when they saw the creature dead, and that \\nI made signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart \\nand came, and began to search for the creature. By the help \\nof a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the negroes to \\nhaul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it was a \\nmost curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree. \\n\\nThe other creature, frighted with the noise of the gun, \\nswam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains whence \\nthey came. I found quickly the negroes wished to eat the \\nflesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it as \\na favour from me. They offered me some of the flesh, which \\nI declined, pointing out that I would give it them ; but made \\nsigns for the skin, which they gave me very freely, and \\nbrought me a great deal more of their provisions. I then \\nmade signs to them for some water, and held out one of my \\njars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show that it was \\nempty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They called im- \\nmediately to some of their friends, and there came two women, \\nand brought a great vessel ; this they set down to me, as \\nbefore, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled \\nthem all three. \\n\\nI was now furnished with roots, corn, and water; and \\nleaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about eleven \\ndays more, without offering to go near the shore. At length, \\ndoubling the point, I saw plainly land on the other side, to \\nseaward : then I concluded that this w r as the Cape de Verd, \\nand those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd \\n\\n\\n\\nCO ROBISSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nIslamic. However, tl;ey were at a great distance, and I could \\nnot tell well what I had best to do ; for if I should be t.ktu \\nwith a fresh of wind, I might neither reach one or other. \\n\\nIn this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the \\ncabin, and sat down, Xury having the helm ; when, on a \\nsudden, the boy cried out, \"Master, master, a ship with a \\nsail !\" and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, think- \\ning it must be some of his master\\'s ships sent to pursue us, \\nbut I knew we were far enough out of their reach. Ijumped \\nout of the cabin, and immediately saw that it was a Portu- \\nguese ship. \\n\\nWith all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able \\nto come in their way, but that they would be gone by before \\nI could make any signal to them ; but after I had crowded to \\nthe utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw, by the \\nhelp of their glasses, that it was some European boat ; so \\nthey shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged \\nwith this, and made them a signal of distress, and fired a gun, \\nboth which they saw. Upon these signals they very kindly \\nbrought to, and lay by for me • and in about three hours\\' \\ntime I came up with them. \\n\\nThey asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, \\nand in French, but I understood none of them ; but, at la*t, \\na Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me ; and I answered \\nhim, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my \\nescape out of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee ; they then \\nbade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all \\nmy goods. \\n\\nIt was an inexpressible joy to me that I was thus delivered \\nfrom such a miserable and almost hopeless condition ; and I \\nimmediately offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a \\nreturn for my deliverance ; but he generously told me he \\nwould take nothing from me, but that all I had should bo de- \\nlivered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. \" Xo, no,\" \\nsays he, \" Seignor Inglese, I will carry you thither in charity, \\nand those things will help to buy your subsistence there, and \\nyour passage home again.\" \\n\\nIn this proposal he was just in the performance to a tittle ; \\nfor he ordered the seamen, that none should touch anything \\nthat I had : then he took everything into his own possesion, \\nand -gave me back an exact inventory of them. \\n\\n\\n\\nHOEIXSOX CfiUSCE. CI \\n\\nMy boat was a very good one ; and ho told mo he would \\nbuy it. I- told him, he had been \\\\o generous to me that I \\ncould not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it \\nentirely to him : upon which he told me he would live me a \\nnote of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it. He \\noffered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy Xury ; \\nbut I was very loath to sell the poor boy\\'s liberty, who had \\nassisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However, \\nwhen I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and \\noffered that he would set him free in ten years, if he turned \\nChristian : upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go \\nto him, I let the captain have him. \\n\\nWe had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in \\nAll Saints\\' Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now \\nI was once more delivered from the most miserable of all con- \\nditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was to \\nconsider. \\n\\nThe generous treatment the captain gave me I can never \\nenough remember : he would take nothing of mo for my \\npassage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard\\'s skin, and \\nforty for the lion\\'s skin, and caused everything I had in the \\nship to be punctually delivered to me ; and what I was will- \\ning to sell he bought of me : in a word, I made about two \\nhundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo ; and \\nwith this stock I went on shore in the Brazils. \\n\\nI had not been long here before I was recommended to the \\nhouse of a good honest man, who had a plantation and suga.\\'- \\nbouse. I lived with him some time, and acquainted myself \\nwith the manner of planting and making of sugar; and seeing \\nhow well the planters lived, and how they got rich suddenly, \\nI resolved, if I could get a licence to settle there, 1 would \\nturn planter : resolving, in the meantime, to find out some \\nway to got my money, which I had left in London, remitted \\nto me. To this purpose, getting a letter of naturalization, 1 \\npurchased as much land as my money would reach, and formed- \\na plan for my plantation and settlement suitable to the stock \\nwhich I proposed to myself to receive from England. \\n\\nI had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of \\nEnglish parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such \\ncircumstances as I was. My stock was low, as well as his ; \\nand v. - e rather planted for food than anything else, for about \\n\\n\\n\\n*j2 KOEINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ntwo years. However, we began to increase, and our land \\nbegan to come into order ; so that the third year we planted \\nsome tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground \\nready for planting canes in the year to come : but we both \\nwanted help ; and now I found I had done wrong in parting \\nwith Xury. \\n\\nBut I had no remedy but to go on : I had got into an em- \\nployment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to \\nthe life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my father\\'s \\nhouse, and broke through all his good advice. \\n\\nI had nobocby to converse with, but now and then this \\nneighbour ; no work to be done, but by the labour of my \\nhands ; and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast away \\nupon some desolate island, that had nobody there but himself. \\n\\nI was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying \\non the plantation, before my kind friend the captain went \\nback ; for the ship remained there nearly three months ; when, \\ntelling him what little stock I had left behind me in London, \\nho gave me this friendly and sincere advice : — \" Seignor In- \\nglese,\" says he (for so lie always called me), \" if you Mill \\ngive me letters to the person who has your money in London, \\nto send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, \\nand in such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring \\nyou the produce of them : but I would have you give orders \\nbut for one hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half \\nyour stock, and let the hazard be run for the first ; so that if \\nit come safe, you may order the rest the same way ; and, if it \\nmiscarry, you may have the other half to have recourse to for \\nyour supply.\" \\n\\nThis was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that \\nI could not but be convinced it was the best course I could \\ntake ; so I prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I \\nhad left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese \\ncaptain, as he desired. \\n\\nI wrote the English captain\\'s widow a full account of all \\nmy adventures, and what condition I was now in, with all \\nother necessary directions for my supply ; and when this \\nhonest captain came to Lisbon, he found means to send over, \\nnot the order only, but a full account of my story to a mer- \\nchant at London, who represented it effectually to her : where- \\nupon she not only delivered the money, but, out of her own \\n\\n\\n\\nHOBINSON CRUSOE. S3 \\n\\npocket, sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present \\nior his humanity and charity. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 41. \\nThe merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in \\nEnglish goods, such as the captain had written for, sent then? \\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\n34 KOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ndirectly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me \\nto the Brazils : among which he had taken care to have all \\nsorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, necessary for m*.- plan- \\ntation, and which were of great use to me. \\n\\nWhen this cargo arrived, I thought my fortunes made, for \\nI was surprised with the joy of it ; and my good steward, the \\ncaptain, had laid out the five pounds, which my friend had \\nsent him for a present for himself, to purchase and bring me \\nover a servant, under bond for six years\\' service, and would \\nnot accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which \\nI would have him accept, being of my own produce. \\n\\nNeither was this all ; for my goods being all English manu- \\nfacture, particularly valuable in the country, I found means to \\nsell them to a very great advantage ; so that I had more than \\nfour times the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely \\nbeyond my poor neighbour in the advancement of my plan- \\ntation ; for the first thing I did I bought a negro slave, and \\na European servant also, besides that which the captain \\nbrought me from Lisbon. \\n\\nI went on the next year with great success in my planta- \\ntion; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, \\nmore than I had disposed of for necessaries among my neigh- \\nbours , and these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundred \\nweight, were well cured, and laid by against the return of the \\nfleet from Lisbon; and now increasing in business and in \\nwealth, my head began to be full of projects and undertakings \\nbeyond my reach. \\n\\nTo come, then, by the just degrees, to the particulars oi \\nthis part of my story : — You may suppose that having now \\nlived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive \\nand prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only \\nlearned the language, but had contracted acquaintance and \\nfriendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among the \\nmerchants at St. Salvador, which was our port ; and that, in \\nmy discourses among them, I had frequently given them an \\naccount of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea ; the \\nmanner of trading with the negroes there, and how easy it \\nwas to purchase upon the coast for trifles — such as beads, \\ntoys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like — \\nnot only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants\\' teeth, S:c, but \\nnegroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers. \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CRUSOE. So \\n\\nThey listened always very attentively to my discourses on \\nthese heads, but especially to that part which related to the \\nbuying negroes ; which was a trade, at that time, not only \\nnot far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on \\nby the permission of the Kings of Spain and Portugal, and \\nengrossed in the public stock ; so that few negroes were \\nbought, and those excessively dear. \\n\\nIt happened, being in company with some merchants and \\nplanters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very \\nearnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and \\ntold me they had been musing very much upon what I had \\ndiscoursed with them of the last night, and they came to \\nmake a secret proposal to me ; and, after enjoining me secrecy, \\nthey told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to Guinea; \\nthat they had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened \\nfor nothing so much as servants ; that as it was a trade that \\ncould not be carried on, because they could not publicly sell \\nthe negroes when they came home, so they desired to make \\nbut one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and \\ndivide them among their own plantations ; and, in a word, \\nthe question was, whether I would go their supercargo in the \\nship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea ; \\nand they offered me that I should have my equal share of the \\nnegroes, without providing any part of the stock. \\n\\nThis was a fair proposal, had it been made to any one that \\nhad not had a settlement and a plantation of his own to look \\nafter, which was in a fair way of coming to be very consider- \\nable, and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was \\nthus entered and established, and had nothing to do but to \\ngo on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and to \\nhave sent for the other hundred pounds from England ; and \\nwho in that time could scarce have failed of being worth three \\nor four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too — \\nfor me to think of such a voyage was the most preposterous \\nthing that ever man in such circumstances could be guilty of. \\n\\nBut I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no \\nmore resist the offer than I could restrain my first rambling \\ndesigns. In a word, I told them I would go with all my \\nheart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in \\nmy absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, \\nif I miscarried. This they all entered into covenants to do ; \\n\\n\\n\\n36 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nand I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation and \\neffects, in case of my death, making the captain of the ship \\nthat had saved my life my heir, but obliging him to dispose \\nof my effects ; one-half of the produce being to himself, and \\nthe other to be shipped in England. \\n\\nIn short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, \\nand to keep up my plantation : had I used half as much pru- \\ndence to have looked into my own interest, I had certainly \\nnever gone away from so prosperous an undertaking, upon a \\nvoyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say \\nnothing of particular misfortunes to myself. \\n\\nBut I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of \\nmy fancy rather than my reason ; and accordingly, the ship \\nbeing fitted out, the cargo furnished, and all things done, as \\nby agreement, by my partners in the voyage, I went on board \\nin an evil hour, the 1st of September, 1659, being the same \\nday eight years that I went from my father and mother at \\nHull. \\n\\nOur ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, \\ncarried six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his \\nboy, and myself ; we had on board no large cargo of goods, \\nexcept of such toys as were fit for our trade with the negroes, \\nsuch as beads, bits of glass, shells, and other trifles, especially \\nlittle looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like. \\n\\nThe same day I went on board we set sail, standing away \\nto the northward upon our own coast, with a design to stretch \\nover for the African coast. We had very good weather till \\nwe came to the height of Cape St. Augustino ; whence, keep- \\ning farther off at sea, we lost eight of land, and steered as if \\nwe were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha. In this \\ncourse we passed the line in about twelve days\\' time, when a \\nviolent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our know- \\nledge. It blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve \\ndays together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding \\naway before it, let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury \\nof the winds directed. \\n\\nIn this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one \\nof our men die of the calenture, and one man and the boy \\nwashed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather \\nabating a little, the master made an observation as well as he \\ncould, and found that he was upon the coast of Guiana, and \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 \\n\\nbegan to consult with me what course he should take, for the \\nship was leaky, and very much disabled, and he was going \\ndirectly back to the coast of Brazil. \\n\\nI was positively against that ; and looking over the charts \\nof the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there \\nwas no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we \\ncame within the circle of the Carribbee Islands, and therefore \\nresolved to stand away for Barbadoes ; which, by keeping off \\nat sea, to avoid the in-draft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we \\nmight easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days\\' sail ; \\nwhereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast \\nof Africa without some assistance both to our ship and to \\nourselves. \\n\\nWith this design, we changed our course, in order to reach \\nsome of our English islands, where I hoped for relief; but \\nour voyage was otherwise determined ; for a second storm \\ncame upon us, which carried us away with the same impetu- \\nosity westward, and drove us so out of the way of all human \\ncommerce, that had all our lives been saved as to the sea, we \\nwere rather in danger of being devoured by savages, than \\never returning to our own country. \\n\\nIn this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our \\nmen early in the morning cried out, \" Land !\" and we had no \\nsooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing \\nwhereabouts in the world we were, than the ship struck upon \\na sand, and in a moment the sea broke over in such a manner \\nthat we expected we should all have perished ; and we were \\nimmediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from \\nthe very foam and spray of the sea. \\n\\nIt is not easy for anyone who has not been in the like con- \\ndition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in \\nsuch circumstances. We knew not where we were, or upon \\nwhat land we were driven ; and as the rage of the wind was \\nstill great, we could not hope to have the ship hold many \\nminutes without breaking into pieces, unless the winds, by a \\nkind of miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, \\nwe sat looking upon one another, and expecting death every \\nmoment, every man preparing for another world ; for there \\nwas little or nothing more for us to do in this ; but, contrary \\nto our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and the master \\nsaid the wind began to abate. \\n\\n\\n\\n38 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nNov/, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, \\nyet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking \\ntoo fast for us to expect her getting oft\\', we were in a dreadful \\ncondition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of \\nsaving our lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our \\nstern just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing \\nagainst the ship\\'s rudder, and, in the next place, she broke \\naway, and either sunk or was driven off to sea ; so there was \\nno hope from her. We had another boat on board, but how \\nto get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing ; however, there \\nwas no time to debate, for we fancied the ship would break \\nin pieces every minute, and some told us she was actually \\nbroken already. \\n\\nIn this distress, the mate of our vessel Laid hold of the \\nboat, and with the help of the rest of the men, got her slung \\nover the ship\\'s side ; and getting all into her, let go, and com- \\nmitted ourselves, being eleven in number, to God\\'s mercy \\nand the wild sea. \\n\\nAnd now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we all saw \\nplainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not \\nlive, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to \\nmaking sail, we had none ; so we worked at the oar towards \\nthe land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execu- \\ntion ; for we all knew that when the boat came nearer the \\nshore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach \\nof the sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the \\nmost earnest manner ; and the wind driving us towards the \\nshore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, pull- \\ning as well as we could towards land. \\n\\nAfter we had rowed or rather driven about a league and a \\nhalf, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came \\nrolling astern of us with such fury, that it overset the boat at \\nonce ; and separating us, as well from the boat as from one \\nanother, gave us not time to say, <■\\' O God!\" for we were all \\nswallowed up in a moment. \\n\\nNothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, \\nwhen I sank into the water : for though I swam very well, \\nyet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw \\nbreath, till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me, \\na vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself, \\nwent back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half \\n\\n\\n\\nROBIXSOX CRUSOE. 39 \\n\\ndead with the water I took in. i had so much presence of \\nmind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the \\nmain land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endea- \\nvoured to make on towards the land as fast as I could, before \\nanother wave should return and take me up again : but I soon \\nfound it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come \\nafter me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an \\nenemy, which I had no means or strength to contend with : \\nmy business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon \\nthe water, if I could : and so, by swimming, to preserve my \\nbreathing and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible, my \\ngreatest concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry \\nme a great way towards the shore when it came on, might not \\ncarry me back again with it when it gave back towards the sea. \\n\\nThe wave that came upon me again, buried me at once \\ntwenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I could feel \\nmyself carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the \\nshore a very great way ; but I held my breath, and assisted \\nmyself to swim still forward with all my might. I was ready \\nto burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself raising \\nup, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands \\nshoot out above the surface of the water ; and though it was \\nnot two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it \\nrelieved greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was \\ncovered again with water a good while, but not so long but I \\nheld it out ; and finding the water had spent itself, and began \\nto return, I struck forward against the return of the waves, \\nand felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few mo- \\nments, to recover breath, and till the waters went from me, \\nand then took to my heels and ran, with what strength I had, \\nfarther towards the shore. But neither would this deliver \\nme from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me \\nagain ; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and car- \\nried forwards as before, the shore being very fiat. \\n\\nThe last time of those two had well nigh been fatal to me ; \\nfor the sea having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or \\nrather dashed me, against a piece of a rock, and that with \\nsuch force, as left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my \\nown deliverance ; for the blow taking my side and breast, \\nbeat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body ; and had it \\nreturned again immediatclv, I must have been strangled in \\n\\n\\n\\n40 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nthe water : but I recovered a little before the return of the \\nwaves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water, \\nI resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold \\nmy breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now, as the \\nwaves were not so high as at first, being nearer land, I held \\nmy hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run, \\nwhich brought me so near the shore, that the next wave, \\nthough it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as \\nto carry me away ; and the next run I took, I got to the \\nmain land ; where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the \\ncliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from \\ndanger, and quite out of the reach of the water. \\n\\nI was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up \\nand thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein \\nthere was, some minutes before, scarce any room to hope. I \\nbelieve it is impossible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies \\nand transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may \\nsay, out of the very grave. \\n\\nI walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands ; and my \\nwhole being, as I may say, wrapt up in a contemplation of \\nmy deliverance ; making a thousand gestures and motions, \\nwhich I cannot describe ; reflecting upon all my comrades \\nthat were drowned, and that there should not be one soul \\nsaved but myself ; for, as for them, I never saw them after- \\nwards, or any sign of them, except three of their hats, one \\ncap, and two shoes that w r ere not fellows. \\n\\nI cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and \\nfroth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay \\nso far off ; and considered, Lord ! how was it possible I could \\nget on shore ? \\n\\nAfter I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of \\nmy condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of \\nplace I was in, and what was next to be done : and I soon \\nfound my comforts abate, and that I had a dreadful de- \\nliverance : for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any- \\nthing either to eat or drink ; neither did I see any prospect \\nbefore me, but that of perishing with hunger, or being de- \\nvoured by wild beasts : and that which was particularly \\nafflicting to me was, that I had no weapon, either to hunt \\nand kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself \\nagainst any other creature that might desire to kill me for \\n\\n\\n\\nEOB1NSON CRUSOE. 41 \\n\\ntheirs. In a word, I had nothing about mo but a knife, a \\ntobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all _ my \\nprovision ; and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, \\nthat, for a while, I ran about like a madman. Night coming \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npage 54. \\n\\n\\n\\nupon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would \\nbe my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that couritry, \\nas at night they always come abroad for their prey. \\n\\nAll the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, \\nwas to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny, \\n\\n\\n\\n42 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nwhich grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and \\nconsider the next day what death I should die, for as yet I \\nsaw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from the \\nshore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I \\ndid to my great joy; and having drunk, and put a little to- \\nbacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and \\ngetting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so as that, if \\nI should sleep, I might not fall. And having cut a short \\nstick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging ; \\nand having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and \\nslept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my \\ncondition, and found myself more refreshed with it than I \\nthink I ever was on such an occasion. \\n\\nWhen I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and \\nthe storm abated, so that the sea did not rago and swell as \\nbefore ; but that which surprised me most was, that the ship \\nwas lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay, by \\nthe swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as \\nthe rock, where I had been so bruised by the wave dashing \\nme against it. This being within about a mile from the shore \\nwhere I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I \\nwished myself on board, that at least I might save some neces- \\nsary things for my use. \\n\\nWhen I came down from the tree, I looked about me again, \\nand the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the \\nwind and sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two \\nmiles on my right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the \\nshore to have got to her ; but found a neck, or inlet, of water \\nbetween me and the boat, which was about half a mile broad ; \\nso I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting \\nat the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present \\nsubsistence. \\n\\nA little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide \\nebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile \\nof the ship. And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief, \\nfor I saw that if we had kept on board, we had been all safe : \\nthat is to say, Ave had all got safe on shore, and I had not \\nbeen so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort \\nand company, as I now was. This forced tears to my eyes \\nagain; but I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship ; so I \\npulled off my clothes, and took the water. But when I came \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 43 \\n\\nto the ship, ray difficulty was still greater to know how to get \\non board ; for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water, \\nthere was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam \\nround her twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of \\nrope, which hung down by the fore-chains so low, that with \\ngreat difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope \\nI got up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that \\nthe ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her \\nhold ; but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, \\nthat her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, \\nalmost to the water. By this means all her quarter was free, \\nand all that was in that part was dry. First, I found that all \\nthe ship\\'s provisions were untouched by the water. I also \\nfound some rum in the great cabin, Now I wanted nothing \\nbut a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I fore- \\nsaw would be very necessary to me. \\n\\nWo had several spare yards, and two or three large spars of \\nwood, and a spare top-mast or two in the ship : I resolved to \\nfall to work with these, and I flung as many of them overboard \\nas I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a \\nrope, that they might not drive away. When this was done, \\nI went down the ship\\'s side and pulling them to me, I tied \\nfour of them together at both ends, as well as I could, in the \\nform of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank \\nupon them, cross-ways, I found I could walk upon it very well, \\nbut that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces \\nbeing too light. So I went to work, and with the carpenter\\'s \\nsaw I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added them \\nto my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains. But the \\nhope of furnishing myself with necessaries, encouraged me to \\ngo beyond what I should have been able to have done upon \\nanother occasion. \\n\\nMy raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. \\nMy next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve \\nwhat I laid upon it from the surf of the sea : but I was not \\nlong considering this. I first laid all the plank or boards upon \\nit that I could get, and having considered well what I most \\nwanted, I got three of the seamen\\'s chests, which I had broken \\nopen and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft ; the \\nfirst of these I filled with bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five \\npieces of dried goat\\'s flesh, and a little European corn. As \\n\\n\\n\\n44 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nfor liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our \\nskipper, in which were some cordial waters ; and, in all, about \\nfive or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves, \\nthere being no need to put them into the chest, nor any room \\nfor them. It was after long searching that I found out the \\ncarpenter\\'s chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, \\nand much more valuable than a ship-lading of gold would have \\nbeen at that time. I got it down to my raft, whole as it was, \\nwithout losing time to look into it, for I knew in general \\nwhat it contained. \\n\\nMy next care was for some ammunition and arms. There \\nwere two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two \\npistols. These I secured first, with some powder-horns and a \\nsmall bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. There were \\nthree barrels of powder in the ship, but I knew not where our \\ngunner had stowed them ; but with much search I found two \\nof them dry and good. Those two I got to my raft, with the \\narms. And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and \\nbegan to think how I should get to shore with them, having \\nneither sail, oar, or rudder ; and the least cap-full of wind \\nwould have overset all my navigation. \\n\\nI had three encouragements : 1st, a smooth, calm sea ; \\n2ndly, the tide rising and setting in to the shore ; 3rdly, what \\nlittle wind there was blew me towards the land. And thus, \\nhaving found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat, \\nand besides the tools which were in the chest, two saws, an \\naxe, and a hammer ; with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, \\nor thereabouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it \\ndrive a little distant from the place where I had landed before ; \\nby which I perceived that there was some indraft of the water, \\nand consequently, I hoped to find some creek or river there, \\n■which I might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo. \\n\\nAs I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a \\nlittle opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the \\ntide set into it ; so I guided my raft, as well as I could, to \\nkeep in the middle of the stream. \\n\\nBut here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, \\nwhich, if I had, I think, verily, would have broke my heart ; \\nfor, knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one \\nend of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other end, \\nit wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 \\n\\nthe end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did \\nmy utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep \\nthem in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all \\nmy strength ; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in : \\nbut holding up the chests with all my might, I stood in that \\nmanner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the water \\nbrought me a little more upon a level ; and, a little after, the \\nwater still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off \\nwith the oar I had into the channel, and then driving up \\nhigher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, \\nwith land on both sides, and a strong current running up. I \\nlooked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, resolved \\nto place myself as near the coast as I could. \\n\\nAt length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, \\nto which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and \\nat last got so near, that reaching ground with my oar, I could \\nthrust her directly in. But here I had like to have dipped all \\nmy cargo into the sea again ; for that shore lying pretty steep \\n— there was no place to land, but where one end of my float, \\nif it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower, \\nas before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All that I \\ncould do, was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping \\nthe raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast \\nto the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected \\nthe water would flow over ; and so it did. As soon as I found \\nwater enough, I thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground, \\nand there moored her, by sticking my two broken oars into \\nthe ground, — one on one side, near one end, and one on the \\nother side, near the other end ; and thus I lay till the water \\nebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore. \\n\\nMy next work was to view the country, and seek a proper \\nplace for my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure \\nthem from whatever might happen. Where I was, I yet knew \\nnot : whether on the continent or an island ; whether inhabited \\nor not inhabited ; whether in danger of wild beasts or not. \\nThere was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very \\nsteep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills, \\nwhich lay as in a ridge from it, northward. I took out one \\nof the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of \\npowder ; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the \\ntop of that hill, where, after I had with great labour and \\n\\n\\n\\n46 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ndifficulty got to the top, I saw my fato, to my great affliction, \\nviz., that I was in an island environo 1 on every side by the \\nsea : no land to be seen except some rocks, which lay a great \\nway off, and two small islands, less than this, which lay about \\nthree leagues to the west. \\n\\nI found also that the island I was in was barren, and \\nuninhabited. Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not \\ntheir kinds, neither, when I killed them, could I tell what was \\nfit for food, and what not. At my coming back I shot at a \\ngreat bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree, on the side of a \\nwood. I believe it was the first gun that had been fired there \\nsince, the creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, than \\nfrom all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number \\nof fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming and \\ncrying, every one according to his usual note, but not one of \\nthem of any kind that I knew. As for the creature I killed, \\nI took it to be a kind of a hawk, its colour and beak resembling \\nit, but it had no talons or claws more than common. Its flesh \\nwas carrion, and fit for nothing. \\n\\nContented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and \\nfell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the \\nrest of that day : what to do with myself at night I knew not, \\nnor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the \\nground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour me. \\n\\nHowever, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with \\nthe chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made \\na kind of hut for that night\\'s lodging. As for food, I yet saw \\nnot which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two \\nor three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I shot \\nthe fowl. \\n\\nI now began to consider that I might yet get a great many \\nthings out of the ship, which would be useful to me, and \\nparticularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things \\nas might come to land ; and I resolved to make another voyage \\non board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that the first \\nstorm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I \\nresolved to set all other things apart, till I had got everything \\nout of the ship that I could get. \\n\\nI got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second \\nraft ; and, having had experience of the first, I neither made \\nthis so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, I brought away several \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 \\n\\nthings very useful to me ; as, first, in the carpenter\\'s stores, \\nI found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw- \\njack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above all, that most \\nuseful thing called a grindstone. All these I secured, together \\nwith several things belonging to the gunner; particularly two \\nor three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven \\nmuskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small quantity \\nof powder more ; a large bagful of small shot, and a great roll \\nof sheet-lead ; but this last was so heavy I could not hoist it \\nup to get it over the ship\\'s side. \\n\\nBesides these things, I took all the men\\'s clothes that I could \\nfind, and a spare fore-top sail, a hammock, and some bedding ; \\nand with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all \\nsafe on shore, to my very great comfort. \\n\\nI was under some apprehension during my absence from the \\nland, that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore: \\nbut when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor; only \\nthere sat a creature like a wild cat, upon one of the chests, \\nwhich, when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, and \\nthen stood still. She sat very composed and unconcerned, and \\nlooked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted \\nwith me. I presented my gun to her, but, as she did not \\nnunderstad it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she \\noffer to stir away ; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, \\nthough, by the way, I was not very free of it : however, I \\nspared her a bit, and she ate it, and looked (as if pleased) for \\nmore ; but I thanked her, and could spare no more : so she \\nmarched off. \\n\\nHaving got my second cargo on shore — though I was \\nobliged to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by \\nparcels, for they were too heavy, being large casks — I went \\nto work to make me a little tent, with the sail, and some poles \\nwhich I cut for that purpose : and into this tent I brought \\neverything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun ; \\nand I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round \\nthe tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from \\nman or beast. \\n\\nWhen I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent \\nwith some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end \\nwithout ; and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, \\nlaying my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at length \\n\\n\\n\\n48 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nby me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly \\nall night, for I was very weary and heavy. \\n\\nI had the bi^est magazine of all kinds now that ever was \\nlaid up, I believe, for one man ; for while the ship sat upright, \\nI got everything out of her that I could : so every day, at \\nlow water, I went on board, and brought away something or \\nother ; but particularly the third time I went, I brought away \\nas much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes \\nand rope twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, \\nwhich was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of \\nwet gunpowder. \\n\\nBut that which comforted me more still, was, last of all, \\nafter I had made five or six voyages, and thou^it I had no- \\nthing more to expect from the ship that was worth my med- \\ndling with, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large \\nrunlets of rum, or spirits, a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine \\nflour. I soon emptied the hogshead of the bread, and wrapped \\nit up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut out, \\nand got all this safe on shore also. \\n\\nThe next day I made another voyage, and now, having \\nplundered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, \\nI began with the cables, cutting the great cable into pieces, \\nsuch as I could move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore, \\nwith all the iron-work I could get ; and having cut down the \\nspritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and everything I could, to \\nmake a large raft, I loaded it with all these heavy goods, and \\ncame away ; but my good luck began now to leave me ; for \\nthis raft was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was \\nentered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my \\ngoods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, \\nit overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water ; my \\ncargo was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I \\nexpected would have been of great use to me : however, when \\nthe tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and \\nsome of the iron, though with infinite labour. After this, I \\nwent every day on board, and brought away what I could get. \\n\\nI had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven \\ntimes on board the ship ; but preparing the twelfth time to go \\non board, I found the wind began to rise : however, at low \\nwater I went on board, and though I thought I had rum- \\nmaged the cabin so effectually that nothing more could be \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n49 \\n\\n\\n\\nfound, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of \\n■which I found two or three razors, and one pair of large \\nscissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks ; \\nin another I found about thirty-six pounds value in money — \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsome European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some \\ngold, and some silver. \\n\\nI smiled to myself at the sight of this money : \" O drug !\" \\n\\nsaid I aloud, \" what art thou good for ? Thou art not worth \\n\\nto me — no, not the taking off the ground : one of those \\n\\nknives is worth all this heap : I have no manner of use for \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\\n\\n50 ROBIN\\'SON CRUSOE. \\n\\nthee ; e\\'en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a \\ncreature whoso life is not worth saving\\'.\" However, upon \\nsecond thoughts, T took it away ; and wrapping all in a piece \\nof canvas, I began to think of making another raft : but \\nwhile I was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, and the \\n•wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a \\nfresh gaie from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that \\nit wasin vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind off \\nshore ; and that it was my business to be gone before the tide \\nof flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the \\nshore at all. Accordingly, I let myself down into the water, \\nand swam across the channel which lay between the ship and \\nthe sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with \\nthe weight of the things I had about me, and partly from the \\nroughness of the water. \\n\\nBut I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all \\nmy wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that \\nnight, and in the morning, when I looked out, behold no more \\nship was to be seen ! \\n\\nMy thoughts were now wholly employed about securing \\nmyself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild \\nbeasts, if any were in the island ; and I had many thoughts \\nof the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to \\nmake — whether I should make me a cave in or a tent upon \\nthe earth ; and, in short, I resolved upon both ; the manner \\nand description of which, it may not be improper to give an \\naccount of. \\n\\nI soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settle- \\nment, because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the \\nsea, and I believed it would not be wholesome, and more par- \\nticularly because there was no fresh water near it ; so I re- \\nsolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of \\nground. \\n\\nI consulted several things in my situation : ] st, health and \\nfresh water ; 2ndly, shelter from the heat of the sun ; 3rdly, \\nsecurity from ravenous creatures, whether men or beasts ; \\n4thly, a view to the sea, that if Grod sent any ship in sight, I \\nmight not lose any advantage for my deliverance. \\n\\nIn search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain \\non the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little \\nplain was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 51 \\n\\ndown upon me from the top. On the side of the rock there \\nwas a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or \\ndoor of a cave ; but there was not really any cave, or way \\ninto the rock, at all. \\n\\nOn the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, \\nI resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hun- \\ndred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a \\ngreen before my door ; and, at the end of it, descended \\nirregularly every way down into the low ground by the sea- \\nside. It was on the>N.N.W side of the hill ; so that it was shel- \\ntered from the heat every day, till it came to a W and by S. sun, \\nor thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting. \\n\\nBefore I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the \\nhollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter, \\nfrom the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter from its \\nbeginning and ending. \\n\\nIn this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, \\ndriving them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, \\nthe bia^est end beins out of the around above five feet and \\na half, and sharpened on the top. The two rows did not stand \\nabove six inches from one another. \\n\\nThen I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, \\nand laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, \\nbetween these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other \\nstakes in the inside, leaning against thcin, about two feet and \\na half high, like a spur to a post ; and this fence was so strong, \\nthat neither man nor beast could get into it or over it. This \\ncost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut the \\npiles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them \\ninto the earth. \\n\\nThe entrance into this place I made to be, 1 not by a door, but \\nby a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder, when I \\nwas in, I lifted over after me ; and so I was completely fenced \\nin and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and con- \\nsequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could \\nnot have done ; though, as it appeared afterwards, there was \\nno need of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehended \\ndanger from. \\n\\nInto this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all \\nmy riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which \\nyou have the account above ; and I made a large tent, which, \\n\\n\\n\\nOZ ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nto preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are \\nvery violent there, I made double, one smaller tent within,^ and \\none larger tent above it; and covered the uppermost with a \\nlarge tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails. \\n\\nAnd now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had \\nbrought on shore, but in a hammock, which had belonged to \\nthe mate of the ship. \\n\\nInto this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything \\nthat would spoil by the wet ; and having thus enclosed all my \\ngoods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had left open, \\nand so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. \\n\\nWhen I had done this, I began to work my way into the \\nrock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down \\nout through my tent, I laid them up within my fence, in the \\nnature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a \\nfoot and a half ; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my \\ntent, which served me like a cellar to my house. \\n\\nIt cost me much labour and many days before all these \\nthings were brought to perfection ; and therefore I must go \\nback to some other things which took up some of my thoughts. \\nAt the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for \\nthe setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of \\nrain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning \\nhappened, and after that, a great clap of thunder, as is \\nnaturally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with \\nthe lightning, as I was with a thought which darted into my \\nmind as swift as the lightning itself : my powder ! My very \\nheart sank within me when I thought that, at one blast, all my \\npowder might be destroyed ; on which, not my defence only, \\nbut the providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended. \\nI was nothing near so anxious about my own danger, though, \\nhad the powder took fire, I should never have known who had \\nhurt me. \\n\\nSuch impression did this make npon me, that after the storm \\nwas over, I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, \\nand applied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the \\npowder, and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope \\nthat whatever might come, it might not all take fire at once ; \\nand to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to make \\none part fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight; \\nand I think my powder, which in all was about two hundred \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. Oo \\n\\nand forty pounds weight, was divided into not less than a \\nhundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did \\nnot apprehend any danger from that ; so I placed it in my new \\ncave, which, in my fancy, I called my kitchen ; and the rest I \\nhid up and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet \\nmight come to it, marking very carefully where I laid it. \\n\\nIn the interval of time while this was doing, I went out \\nonce at least every day with my gun, as well to divert myself, \\nas to see if I could kill anything fit for food ; and as near as I \\ncould, to acquaint myself with what the island produced. \\nThe first time I went out, I presently discovered that there \\nwere goats in the island, which was a great satisfaction to me ; \\nbut then it was attended with this misfortune to me, viz., that \\nthey were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was \\nthe difficultest thing in the world to come at them ; but I was \\nnot discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and \\nthen shoot one, as it soon happened ; for after I had found \\ntheir haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them : I \\nobserved that if they saw me in the valleys, though they were \\nupon the rocks, they would run away, as in a terrible fright ; \\nbut if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the \\nrocks, they took no notice of me ; from whence I concluded, \\nthat by the position of their optics, their sight was so directed \\ndownward, that they did not readily see objects that were \\nabove them ; so afterwards, I took this method — I always \\nclimbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had fre- \\nquently a fair mark. \\n\\nThe first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she- \\ngoat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, \\nwhich grieved me heartily ; for, when the old one fell, the kid \\nstood stock still by her, till I came and took her up ; and not \\nonly so, but when I carried the old one with me, upon my \\nshoulders, the kid followed me quite to my enclosure ; upon \\nwhich, I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and \\ncarried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame ; but \\nit would not eat ; so I was forced to kill it, and ate it myself. \\nThese two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate \\nsparingly, and saved my provisions, my bread especially, as \\nmuch as possibly I could. \\n\\nHaving now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely \\nnecessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to \\n\\n\\n\\n54 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nburn ; and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, \\nand what conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of \\nin its place; but I must now give some little account of myself, \\nand of my thoughts about living, which, it may well be supposed, \\nwere not a few. \\n\\nAnd now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a \\nscene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the \\nworld before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue \\nit in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September, \\nwhen I first set foot upon this horrid island ; when the sun \\nbeing to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my \\nhead : for I reckoned myself by observation, to be in the \\nlatitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes north of the line. \\n\\nAfter I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came \\ninto my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for \\nwant of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the \\nSabbath days; but to prevent this, I cut with my knife upon \\na large post, in capital letters; and making it into a great \\ncross, I set up on the shore where I first landed, \" I came \\non shore here on the 30th of September, 1659.\" \\n\\nUpon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch \\nwith my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as \\nthe rest, and every first day of the month as long again as that \\nlong one; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, \\nand yearly reckoning of time. \\n\\nIn the next place we are to observe that among the many \\nthings I brought out of the ship, I got several things of less \\nvalue, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted setting \\ndown before, as pens, ink, and paper; several parcels in the \\ncaptain\\'s, mate\\'s, gunner\\'s, and carpenter\\'s keeping; three or \\nfour compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspec- \\ntives, charts, and books of navigation ; all which I huddled \\ntogether, whether I might want them or no ; also I found three \\nvery good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from England, \\nand which I had packed up among my things ; some Portu- \\nguese books also; and several other books, all which I care- \\nfully secured. And I must not forgot, that we had in the ship \\na dog, and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have \\noccasion to say something in its place ; for I carried both the \\ncats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship \\n\\n\\n\\nROBIXSON CRUSOE. 55 \\n\\nof himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on \\nshore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me \\nmany years ; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any \\ncompany that he could make up to mc ; I only wanted to have \\nhim talk to me, but that would not do. My pens, ink, and \\npaper I husbanded to the utmost ; and while my ink lasted, \\nI kept things very exact, but after that was gone I could not. \\nfor I could not make ink by any means that I could devise. \\n\\nAnd this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not- \\nwithstanding all that I had amassed together ; and of these, \\nink was one ; as also a spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or \\nremove the earth ; needles, pins, and thread : as for linen, I \\nsoon learned to want that without much difficulty. \\n\\nThis want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; \\nand it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my \\nlittle pale, or surrounded my habitation. The piles or stakes, \\nwhich were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in \\ncutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in bring- \\ning home ; so that I spent sometimes two clays in cutting and \\nbringing home one of these posts, and a third day in driving- \\nit into the ground ; for which purpose, I got a heavy piece of \\nwood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron \\ncrows ; which, however, though I found it, made driving those \\nposts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But what need \\nI have been concerned at the tediousness of anything I had to \\ndo, seeing I had time enough to do it in ? nor had I any other \\nemployment, if that had been over, at least that I could foresee, \\nexcept the ranging the island to sock for food, which I did, \\nmore or less every day. \\n\\nI now began to consider seriously my condition, and the \\ncircumstances I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of \\nmy affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any that \\nshould come after me, for I was likely to have but few heirs, \\nas to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and \\nafilic-ting my mind : and as my reason began now to master \\nmy despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, \\nand to set the good against the evil, that I might have some- \\nthing to distinguish my case from worse; and I stated very \\nimpartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed \\nagainst the miseries I suffered, thus : — \\n\\n\\n\\n56 \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nEvil. \\n\\nI am cast upon a horrible, \\ndesolate island, void of all \\nhope of recovery. \\n\\nI am singled out and sepa- \\nrated, as it were, from all the \\nworld, to be miserable. \\n\\n\\n\\nI am divided from mankind \\n— a solitaire ; one banished \\nfrom human society. \\n\\nI have not clothes to cover \\nme. \\n\\nI am without any defence, \\nor means to resist any vio- \\nlence of man or beast. \\n\\n\\n\\nI have no soul to speak to, \\nor relieve me. \\n\\n\\n\\nGood. \\n\\nBut I am alive, and not \\ndrowned, as all my ship\\'s com- \\npany were. \\n\\nBut I am singled out, too, \\nfrom all the ship\\'s crew, to be \\nspared from death; and He \\nthat miraculously saved me \\nfrom death, can deliver me \\nfrom this condition. \\n\\nBut I am not starved, and \\nperishing on a barren place, \\naffording no sustenance. \\n\\nBut I am in a hot climate, \\nwhere, if I had clothes, I could \\nhardly wear them. \\n\\nBut I am cast on an island \\nwhere I see no wild beasts to \\nhurt me, as I saw on the coast \\nof Africa ; and what if I had \\nbeen shipwrecked there ? \\n\\nBut God wonderfully sent \\nthe ship in near enough to the \\nshore, that I have got out as \\nmany necessary things as will \\neither supply my wanrs or \\nenable me to supply myself, \\neven as long as I live. \\n\\nUpon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that \\nthere was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but \\nthere was something negative or positive to be thankful for \\nin it. \\n\\nHaving now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, \\nand given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship, \\n— I began to apply myself to arrange my way of living, and to \\nmake things as easy to me as I could. \\n\\nI have already described my habitation, which was a tent \\nunder the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of \\nposts and cables ; but I might now rather call it a wall, for I \\nraised a kind of Avail up against it of turfs, about two feet \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 \\n\\nthick on the outside : and after some time (I think it was a \\nyear and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, \\nand thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such \\nthings as I could get, to keep out the rain ; which I found at \\nsome times of the year very violent. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV^a \"-i. \\n\\n\\n\\nI have already observed how I brought all my goods into \\nthe cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe* \\ntoo, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which as \\nthey lay in no order, so they took up all my place ; I had no \\nroom to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my cave, and \\n\\n\\n\\n58 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nwork farther into the earth ; and when I found I was pretty \\nsafe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the right hand \\ninto the rock ; and then turning to the right again, worked \\nquite out and made me a door to come out on the side of my \\npale or fortification. \\n\\nThis gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back- \\nway to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to \\nstore my goods. \\n\\nAnd now I began to apply myself to make such necessary \\nthings as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a \\ntable ; for without those I was not able to enjoy the few \\ncomforts I had in the world ; I could not write, or eat, or do \\nseveral things with so much pleasure, without a table : so I \\nwent to work. And here I must needs observe, that as reason \\nis the substance and origin of the mathematics, so by stating \\nand squaring everything by reason, and by making the most \\nrational judgment of things, every man may be, in time, master \\nof every mccnamc art. I had never handled a tool in my life ; \\nand yet, in time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I \\nfound, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could have made \\nit, especially if I had had tools. However I made abundance \\nof things, even without tools ; and some with no more tools \\nthan an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made \\nthat way before, and that with infinite labour. For example, \\nif I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, \\nset it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side \\nwith my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and \\nthen dub it smooth with my adze. It is true that by this \\nmethod I could make but one board out of a whole tree ; but \\nthis I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I \\nhad for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took \\nme up to make a plank or board : but my time or labour was \\nlittle worth, and so it was as well employed one way as \\nanother. \\n\\nHowever, I made me a table and a chair, in the first place; \\nand this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought \\non my raft from the ship, lint when I had wrought out some \\nboards as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot \\nand a half, one over another all along one side of my cave, to \\nlay all my tools, nails, and iron-work on ; and, to separate \\neverything into their places, that I might come easily at them. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBIXSON CRUSOE. 59 \\n\\n. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns \\nand all things that would hang up : so that my cave looked \\nlike a general magazine of all necessary things ; and I had \\neverything so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure \\nto me to see all my goods in such order, and especially to find \\nmy stock of all necessaries so great. \\n\\nHaving settled my household stuff and habitation, made me \\na table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, \\nI began to keep my journal ; of which I shall here give you \\nthe copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over \\nagain) as long as it lasted ; for having no more ink, I was \\nforced to leave it off. \\n\\nTHE JOURNAL. \\n\\nSeptember 30, 1659. — I, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, \\nbeing shipwrecked during a dreadful storm, in the offing, \\ncame on shore on this dismal, unfortunate island, which I \\ncalled \" The Island of Despair;\" all the rest of the ship\\'s \\ncompany being drowned, and myself almost dead. \\n\\nAll the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the \\ndismal circumstances I was brought to, viz., I had neither food, \\nhouse, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to : and, in despair of \\nany relief, saw nothing but death before me : either that I \\nshould be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or \\nstarved to death for want of food. At the approach of night \\nI slept in a tree for fear of wild creatures ; but slept soundly, \\nthough it rained all night. \\n\\nOctober 1. — In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the \\nship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore \\nagain, much nearer the island ; which as it was some comfort, \\non one hand, for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to \\npieces, I hoped if the wind abated, I might get on board, and \\nget some food and necessaries out of her for my relief; so, on \\nthe other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, \\nwho, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have \\nsaved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all \\ndrowned, as they were; and that, had the men been saved, we \\nmight perhaps have built us a boat, out of the ruins of the \\nship, to have carried us to some other part of the world. I \\nspent great part of this day in perplexing myself on these \\nthings ; but, at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon \\n\\n\\n\\n60 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nthe sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. This \\nday also it continued raining, though with no wind at all. \\n\\nFrom the 1st of October to the 24th. — All these days en- \\ntirely spent in several voyages to get all I could out of the \\nship, which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. \\nMuch rain also in the days, though with some intervals of fair \\nweather; but it seems this was the rainy season. \\n\\nOct. 20. — I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got \\nupon it; but being in shoal water, and the things being \\nchiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was \\nout. \\n\\nOct. 25. — It rained all night and all day, with some gusts \\nof wind ; during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind \\nblowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be \\nseen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I \\nspent this day in covering and securing the goods which I had \\nsaved, that the rain might not spoil them. \\n\\nOct. 26. — I walked about the shore almost all day, to find \\nout a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure \\nmyself from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts \\nor men. Towards night, I fixed upon a proper place, under a \\nrock, and marked out my encampment ; which I resolved to \\nstrengthen with a work, wall, or fortification, made of double \\npiles, lined within with cables, and without with turf. \\n\\nFrom the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying \\nall my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the \\ntime it rained exceedingly hard. \\n\\nThe 31st in the morning, I went out into the island with my \\ngun, to see for some food, and discover the country ; when I \\nkilled a she-goat, and her kid followed me home, which I \\nafterwards killed also because it would not feed. \\n\\nNovember 1. — I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there \\nfor the first night ; making it as large as I could, with stakes \\ndriven in to swing my hammock upon. \\n\\nNov. 2. — I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces \\nof timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence \\nround me, a little within the place I had marked out for my \\nfortification. \\n\\nNov. 3. — I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like \\nducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon went to \\nwork to make me a table. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 61 \\n\\nNov. 4. — This morning I began to order my times of work, \\nof going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion ; \\nviz., every morning I walked out with my gun for two or three \\nhours, if it did not rain ; then employed myself to work till \\nabout eleven o\\'clock ; then ate what I had to live on ; and \\nfrom twelve till two I lay down to sleep, the weather being \\nexcessively hot ; and then, in the evening to work again. The \\nworking part of this day and of the next were wholly em- \\nployed in making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry \\nworkman, though time and necessity made me a complete \\nnatural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would do any \\none else. \\n\\nNov. 5. — This day, went abroad with my gun and my dog, \\nand killed a wild cat ; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good \\nfor nothing ; every creature that I killed I took off the skins \\nand preserved them. Coming back by the sea-shore, I saw \\nmany sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand ; but was \\nsurprised, and almost frightened, with two or three seals, which, \\nwhile I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got \\ninto the sea, and escaped me for that time. \\n\\nNov. 6. — After my morning walk, I went to work with my \\ntable again, and finished it, though not to my liking ; nor was \\nit long before I learned to mend it. \\n\\nNov. 7. — Now it began to be settled fair weather. The \\n7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was \\nSunday), I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with \\nmuch ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to \\nplease me ; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces \\nseveral times. \\n\\nNote. — I soon neglected my keeping Sundays ; for, omit- \\nting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was which. \\n\\nNov. 13. — This day it rained, which refreshed me exceed- \\ningly, and cooled the earth ; but it was accompanied with \\nterrible thunder and lightning, which frighted me dreadfully, \\nfor fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved \\nto separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as \\npossible, that it might not be in danger. \\n\\nNov. 14, 15, 16. — These three days I spent in making little \\nsquare chests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or \\ntwo pounds at most, of powder; and so, putting the powder \\nin, I stowed it in places as secure and remote from one \\n\\n\\n\\nC2 ROBINSOX CRUSOE. \\n\\nanother as possible. On one of these three clays, I killed a \\nlarge bird that was good to eat, but I knew not what to \\ncall it. \\n\\nNov. 17. — This day I began to dig behind my tent into the \\nrock, to make room for my further convenience. \\n\\nNote. — Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, \\nviz., a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket ; so I \\ndesisted from my work, and began to consider how to supply \\nthat want, and make me some tools. As for the pickaxe, I \\nmade use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, \\nthough heavy ; but the next thing was a shovel or spade ; \\nthis was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do \\nnothing effectually without it ; but what kind of one to make \\nI knew not. \\n\\nNov. 18. — The next day, in searching the woods, I found a \\ntree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call \\nthe iron-tree, for its exceeding hardness ; of this, with great \\nlabour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought \\nit home, too, with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding \\nheavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my having \\nno other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I \\n•worked it effectually, by little and little, into the form of a \\nshovel or spade ; the handle exactly shaped like ours in \\nEngland, only that the board part having no iron shod upon \\nit at bottom, it would not last me so long ; however, it \\nserved well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put \\nit to. \\n\\nI was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or a wheel- \\nbarrow. A basket I could not make by any means, having \\nno such things as twigs that would bend to make wicker-ware \\n— at least, none yet found out ; and as to a wheelbarrow, I \\nfancied I could make all but the wheel ; but that I had no \\nnotion of; neither did I know how to go about it ; besides, I \\nhad no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle \\nor axis of the wheel to run in ; so I pave it over, and so, for \\ncarrying away the earth which I dug out of the cave, I made \\nme a thing like a hod, which the labourers carry mortar in, \\nwhen they serve the bricklayers. This was not so difficult to \\nme as the making the shovel ; and yet this and the shovel, and \\nthe attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took \\nme up no less than four days. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBIXSON CRUSOE. 63 \\n\\nNov. 23. — My other work having now stood still, because \\nof my making these tools, when they were finished I went on, \\nand working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I \\nspent eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my \\ncave, that it might hold my goods commodiously. \\n\\nNote. — During all this time, I worked to make this room, or \\ncave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse, or \\nmagazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my \\nlodging, I kept to the tent ; except that sometimes, in the wet \\nseason of the year, it rained so hard, that I could not keep \\nmyself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my place \\nwithin my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning \\nagainst the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of \\ntrees, like a thatch. \\n\\nDecember 10. — I began to think my cave or vault finished, \\nwhen on a sudden (it seems I had made it too largo) a great \\nquantity of earth fell down from the top and one side; so \\nmuch that it frighted me, and not without reason, too ; for if \\nI had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-digger. I \\nhad now a great deal of work to do over again, for I had the \\nloose earth to carry out : and, which was of more importance, \\nI had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more \\nwould come down. \\n\\nDec. 11. — This day I went to work with it accordingly, and \\ngot tw-o shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two \\npieces of boards across over each post ; this I finished the next \\nday ; and setting more posts up with boards, in about a week \\nmore I had the roof secured ; and the posts, standing in rows, \\nserved me for partitions to part off the house. \\n\\nDec. 17. — From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and \\nknocked up nails on the posts, to hang everything up that \\ncould be hung up ; and now I began to be in some order within \\ndoors. \\n\\nDec 20. — Now I carried everything into the cave, and \\nbegan to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards \\nlike a dresser, to order my victuals upon , but boards began \\nto be very scarce with me : also I made me another table. \\n\\nDec. 24. — Much rain all night and all day : no stirring out. \\n\\nDec. 2.1. — Bain all day. \\n\\nDec. 20. — No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, \\nand pleasanter. \\n\\n\\n\\nC4 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nDec. 27. — Killed a young goat, and lamed another so that \\nI caught it, and led it home in a string ; when I had it at \\nhome, I bound and splintered up its leg, which was broken. \\n\\nN.B.— I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew \\nwell and as strong as ever : but by nursing it so long it grew \\ntame, and fed upon the little green at my door, and would not \\ngo away. This was the first time that I entertained a thought \\nof breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food \\nwhen my powder and shot was all spent. \\n\\nx Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31 Great heats, and no breeze, so that \\n\\nthere was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for \\nfc-/d ; this time I spent in putting all my things in order \\nwithin doors. \\n\\nJanuary 1. — Very hot still ; but I went abroad early and \\nlate with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This \\nevening, goin^ farther into the valleys which lay towards the \\ncentre of the island, I found there were plenty of goats, though \\nexceedingly shy, and hard to come at ; however, I resolved to \\ntry if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down. \\n\\nJan. 2. — Accordingly, the next day I went out with my \\ndog, and set him upon the goats ; but I was mistaken, for they \\nall faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger too well, \\nfor he would not come near them. \\n\\nJan. 3. — I began my fence, or wall; which, being still \\njealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make \\nvery thick and strong. \\n\\nN.B. — This wall being described before, I purposely omit \\nwhat was said in the journal ; it is sufficient to observe that I \\nwas no less time than from the 3rd of January to the 14th of \\nApril working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it \\nwas no more than about twenty-four yards in length, being a \\nhalf-circle, from one place in the rock to another place, about \\neight yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre \\nbehind it. \\n\\nAll this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me \\nmany days, nay, sometimes weeks, together ; but I thought I \\nshould never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished ; and \\nit is scarcely credible what inexpressible labour everything was \\ndone with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods, and \\ndriving them into the ground ; for I made them much bi^er \\nthan I needed to have done. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n65 \\n\\n\\n\\n\"When this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced, \\nwith a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that \\nif any people were to come on shore there they would not \\nperceive anything like a habitation ; and it was very well I did \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPAGE 102 \\n\\n\\n\\nso, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable occa- \\nsion. \\n\\nDaring this time I made my rounds in the woods for game \\nevery day, when the rain permitted me, and made frequent \\ndiscoveries in these walks of something or other to my advan- \\n5 \\n\\n\\n\\n66 EOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\niagc; particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, which \\nbuild, not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but rather as house- \\npigeons, in the holes of the rocks ; and taking some young \\nones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so ; but \\nwhen they grew older they flew away, which perhaps was at \\nfirst for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them ; \\nhowever, I frequently found their nests, and got their young \\nones, which were very good meat. And now, in the managing \\nmy household affairs, I found myself wanting in many things, \\nwhich I thought at first it was impossible for me to make ; as, \\nindeed, with some of them it was : for instance, I couM. never \\nmake a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I \\nobserved before, but I could never arrive at the capacity of \\nmaking one by them, though I spent many weeks about it ; I \\ncould neither put in the heads, or join the staves so true to \\none another as to make them hold water ; so I gave that also \\nover. In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles ; so \\nthat as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven \\no\\'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of \\nbees\\'-wax with which I made candles in my African adventure ; \\nbut I had non& of that now ; the only remedy I had was, that \\nwhen I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with., a little \\ndish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which.! added \\na wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this gave me \\nlight, though not a clear steady light like- a candle. In the \\nmiddle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my \\nthings, I found a little bag, which had been filled with corn \\nfor the feeding of poultry. The little remainder of corn that \\nhad been in the bag was all devoured with the rats, and I saw \\nnothing in the bag but husks send dust ; and being willing to \\nhave the bag for some other use, I shook the husks of corn out \\nof it on one side of my fortification, under the rock. \\n\\nIt was a little before the great rains just now mentioned \\nthat I threw this stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much \\nas remembering that I had thrown anything there, when about \\na month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of some- \\nthing green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might \\nbo some plant I had not seen ; but I was surprised, and per- \\nfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about \\nten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley, \\nof the same kind as our English barley. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CIIUSOS. 67 \\n\\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion \\nof my thoughts on this occasion ; I had hitherto acted upon \\nno religious foundation at all ; indeed, I had very few notions \\nof religion in my head, nor had entertained any sense of any- \\nthing that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance, oi\\', as \\nwe lightly say, what pleases God, without so much as inquiring \\ninto the end of Providence in these things, or His order in \\ngoverning events for the world. But after I saw barley grow \\nthere, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and \\nespecially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me \\nstrangely, and I began to suggest that God had miraculously \\ncaused His grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and \\nthat it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that wild, \\nmiserable place. \\n\\nThis touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my \\neyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of \\nnature should happen upon my account ; and this was the \\nmore strange to me, because I saw near it still, all along by \\nthe side of the rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved \\nto be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it \\ngrow in Africa, when I was ashore there. \\n\\nI not only thought these the pure productions of Providence \\nfor my support, but not doubting that there was more in the \\nplace, I went all over that part of the island where I had been \\nbefore, peering in every corner, and under every rock, to see \\nfor more of it, but I could not find any. At last it occurred \\nto my thoughts, that I shook a bag of chickens\\' meat out in \\nthat place, and then the wonder began to cease ; and I must \\nconfess, my religious thankfulness to God\\'s providence began \\nto abate, too, upon the discovering that all this was nothing \\nbut what was common ; though I ought to have been as \\nthankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it \\nhad been miraculous ; for it was really the work of Provi- \\ndence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve \\ngrains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had \\ndestroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven ; \\nas also, that I should throw it out in that particular place, \\nwhere, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up im- \\nmediately ; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, at that \\ntime, it had been burnt up and destroyed. \\n\\nI carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in \\n\\n\\n\\nC8 ROBINSON CUU.SOE. \\n\\ntheir season, which was about the end of June ; and, laying \\nup every corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping, m \\ntime, to have some quantity, sufficient to supply me with, \\nbread. But it was not till the fourth year that I could allow \\nmyself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but \\nsparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order ; for I lost all \\nthat I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper \\ntime ; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it \\nnever came up at all, at least not as it would have done: of \\nwhich in its place. \\n\\nBesides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty \\nstalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care and for \\nthe same use, to make me bread, or rather food ; for I found \\nways to cook it without baking, though I did that also after \\nsome time. \\n\\nBut to return to my Journal : \\n\\nI worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get \\nmy wall done ; and the 14th of April, I closed it up, contriv- \\ning to go into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, \\nthat there might be no sign on the outside of my habitation. \\n\\nApril 16. — I finished the ladder ; so I went up the ladder \\nto the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in \\nthe inside : this was a complete inclosure to me ; for within I \\nhad room enough, and nothing could come at me from with- \\nout, unless it could first mount my wall. \\n\\nThe very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost \\nhad all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed ; the \\ncase was thus : — As I was busy in the inside, behind my tent, \\njust at the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with \\na most dreadful surprising thing indeed : for, all on a sudden, \\nI found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my \\ncave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two of \\nthe posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful man- \\nner. I was heartily scared ; thinking that the top of my cave \\nwas fallen in, as some of it had done before : and for fear I \\nshould be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not \\nthinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear \\nof the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll down \\nupon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm \\nground, than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake ; for \\nthe ground I stood on shook three times at about ei°bt \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 \\n\\nTninutes\\' distance, with three such shocks as would have over- \\nturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have \\nstood on the earth, and a great piece of the top of a rock, \\nwhich stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell \\ndown, with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my \\nlife. I perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion \\nby it ; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water \\nthan on the island. \\n\\nI was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt \\nthe like, nor discoursed with anyone that had, that I was like \\none dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth made my \\nstomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of \\nthe falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing me \\nfrom the stupified condition I was in, filled me with horror, \\nand I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon my \\ntent and all my household goods, and burying all at once ; and \\nthis sunk my very soul within me a second time. \\n\\nAfter the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some \\ntime, I began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough \\nto go over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat \\nstill upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate, not \\nknowing what to do. All this while, I had not the least \\nserious religious thought, nothing but the common \"Lord have \\nmercy upon me!\" and when it was over, that went away too. \\n\\nWhile I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, , \\nas if it would rain ; soon after that, the wind arose by little and \\'. \\nlittle, so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful > > \\nhurricane: the sea was, all on a sudden, covered over with foamf \\nand froth ; the shore was covered with the breach of the water ; \\nthe trees were torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm it \\nwas. This held about three hours, and then began to abate; \\nand in two hours more it was quite calm, and began to rain \\nvery hard. All this while I sat upon the ground, very much \\nterrified and dejected ; when on a sudden it came into my \\nthoughts, that these winds and rain being the consequences of \\nthe earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, \\nand I might venture into my cave again. With this thought, \\nmy spirits began to revive ; and the rain also helping to per- \\nsuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent ; but the rain \\nwas so violent, that my tent was ready to bo beaten down with \\nit ; and I was forced to go into my cave, though very much \\n\\n\\n\\n70 ROBINSOX CRUSOE. \\n\\nafraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. This \\nviolent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a hole through \\nmy new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which \\nwould else have flooded my cave. After I had been in my \\ncave for some time, and found still no more shocks of the earth- \\nquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now to \\nsupport my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went \\nto my little store and took a small sup of rum ; which, however, \\nI did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have \\nno more when that was gone. It continued raining all that \\nnight, and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir \\nabroad; but my mind being more composed, I began to think \\nof what I had best do : concluding, that if the island was sub- \\nject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a \\ncave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open \\nplace, which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, \\nand so make myself secure from wild beasts or men ; for I \\nconcluded if I stayed where I was, I should certainly, one time \\nor other, be buried alive. \\n\\nWith these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the \\nplace where it now stood, which was just under the hanging \\nprecipice of the hill; and which if it should be shaken again, \\nwould certainly fall upon my tent : and I spent the two next \\ndays, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where \\nand how to remove my habitation. The fear of being swal- \\nlowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet ; and yet \\nthe apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost \\nequal to it : but still, when I looked about, and saw how every- \\nthing was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and \\nhow safe from danger, it made me very loath to remove. In \\nthe meantime, it occurred to me that it would require a vast \\ndeal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to \\nventure where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and \\nhad secured it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution \\nI composed myself for a time ; and resolved that I would go \\nto work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, \\n&c, in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it, when it \\nwas finished ; but that I would venture to stay where I was till \\nit was finished and fit to remove. This was the 21st. \\n\\nApril 22. — The next morning I began to consider of means \\n\\n\\n\\nHOBINSON CRUSOE. 71 \\n\\nto put this resolve into execution ; but I was at a great loss \\nabout my tools. I had three large axes, and abundance of \\nhatchets, but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard \\nwood, they were all full of notches, and dull, and though I had \\na grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. \\nThis cost me as much thought as a statesman would have be- \\nstowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life \\nand death of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a \\nstring to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands \\nat liberty. \\n\\nApril 28, 29. — These two whole days I took up in grinding \\nmy tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing \\nvery well. \\n\\nApril 30. — Having perceived my bread had been low a \\ngreat while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to \\none biscuit a day, which made my heart very heavy. \\n\\nMay 1. — In the morning, looking towards the sea side, the \\ntide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than \\nordinary, and it looked like a cask ; when I came to it, I found \\na small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, \\nwhich were driven on shore by the late hurricane ; and looking \\ntowards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out \\nof the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel which \\nwas driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gun- \\npowder, but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as \\nhard as a stone ; however, I rolled it farther on shore for the \\npresent, and went on upon the sands , as near as I could to the \\nwreck of the ship to look for more. \\n\\nWhen I came down to the ship, I found it strangely re- \\nmoved. The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was \\nheaved up at least six feet, and the stern, which was broke in \\npieces and purtde from the rest by the force of the sea, soon \\nafter I had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were, up, and \\ncast on one side ; and the sand was thrown so high on that \\nside next her stern, that whereas there was a great place of \\nwater before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a \\nmile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk quite \\nup to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with this \\nat first, but soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake; \\nand as by this violence the ship was more broke open than \\n\\n\\n\\n72 KOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nformerly, so many things came daily on shore, which the sea \\nhad loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by degrees \\nto the land. \\n\\nThis wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of re- \\nmoving my habitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day \\nespecially, in searching whether I could make any way into \\nthe ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, \\nfor all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand. How- \\never, as I had learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to \\npull everything to pieces that I could of the ship, con- \\ncluding that everything I could get from her would be of some \\nuse or other to me. \\n\\nMay 3. — I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam \\nthrough, which I thought held some of the upper part or \\nquarter deck together, and when I had cut it through, I \\ncleared away the sand as well as I could from the side which \\nlay highest : but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give \\nover for that time. \\n\\nMay 4. — I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that I \\ndurst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when, just going to \\nleave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long \\nline of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks ; yet I frequently \\ncaught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried \\nin the sun, and ate them dry. \\n\\nMay 5. — Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, \\nand brought three great fir-planks off from the decks, which I \\ntied together, and made to float on shore when the tide of flood \\ncame on. \\n\\nMay 6. — Worked on the wreck ; got several iron bolts out \\nof her, and other pieces of iron-work ; worked very hard and \\ncame home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. \\n\\nMay 7. — Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to \\nwork, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself \\ndown, the beams being cut; that several pieces of the ship \\nseemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold lay so open that \\nI could see into it, but it was almost full of water and sand. \\n\\nMay 8. — Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to \\nwrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water \\nor sand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on \\nshore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for \\nnext clay. \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\n\\nMay 9. — Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way \\ninto the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened \\nthem with the crow, but could not break them up. I felt also \\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\ POT s^ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nl\\'AQE 1C7. \\n\\na roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy \\nto remove. \\n\\nMay 10 — 14. — Went every day to the wreck; and got a \\ngreat many pieces of timber and boards or plank, and two \\nor three hundredweight of iron. \\n\\nMay 15. — I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a \\n\\n\\n\\n<4 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\npiece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, \\nand driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and \\na half in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the \\nhatchet. \\n\\nMay 16. — It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck \\nappeared more broken by the force of the water; but I stayed \\nso long in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide \\nprevented my going to the wreck that day. \\n\\nMay 17. — I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, \\nat a great distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see \\nwhat they were, and found it was a piece of the lead, but too \\nheavy for me to bring away. \\n\\nMay 24. — Every clay, to this day, I worked on the wreck; \\nand with hard labour I loosened some things so much with \\nthe crow, that the first blowing tide several casks floated out, \\nand two of the seamen\\'s chests ; but the wind blowing from \\nthe shore, nothing came to land ihat day but pieces of timber, \\nand a hogshead, wtt&i Ibai same Brazil pork in it, but the salt \\nwater and the sandiraflspiHeflit. I continued this work every \\nday to the 15th of J^me, except lire USsme necessary to get food, \\nwhich I always agapainited, during ibis jp»rt of my employment, \\nto be when the fflfenEEs up, thait I anight be ready when it \\nebbed out; and by iMs time I had got timber and plank, and \\niron-work, enough *to have built a good boat, if I had known \\nhow; and also I got at several times, and in severaljieces, near \\none hundred-wsigbt of the sheet-lead. \\n\\nJune 16. — <Gramg down to the sea-side, I founfl a large \\ntortoise, or tur#e. TMs was the first I had seen, winch, it \\nseems, was ordymy misfortune, not any defect of the jalace, or \\nscarcity; for had I Hnajpaaefl to be on the other side of the \\nisland, I might have had Sramdreds of them every day, as I \\nfound afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for \\nthem. \\n\\nJune 17. — I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her \\nthree score eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the \\nmost savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having \\nhad no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this \\nhorrid place. \\n\\nJune 18. — Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought, \\nat this time, the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly ; \\nwhich I knew was not usual in that latitude. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 \\n\\nJune 19. — Very ill and shivering, as if the weather had \\nbeen cold. \\n\\nJune 20. — No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and \\nfeverish. \\n\\nJune 21. — Very ill ; frighted almost to death with the \\napprehension of my sad condition — to be sick, and no help; \\nprayed to God, for the first time since the storm off Hull, but \\nscarce knew what I said, or why; my thoughts being all \\nconfused. \\n\\nJune 22. — A little better ; but under dreadful apprehensions \\nof sickness. \\n\\nJune 23. — Very bad again ; cold and shivering, and then a \\nviolent headache. \\n\\nJune 24. — Much better. \\n\\nJune 25. — An ague very violent: the fit held me seven \\nhours : cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it. \\n\\nJune 26. — Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took my \\ngun, but found myself very weak : however, I killed a she-goat, \\nand with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, \\nand ate. I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, \\nbut had no pot. \\n\\nJune 27. — The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all \\nday, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for \\nthirst ; but so weak, I had not strength to stand up, or to get \\nmyself any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was \\nlight-headed ; and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I \\nknew not what to say ; only I lay and cried, \" Lord, look upon \\nme! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!\" I suppose \\nI did nothing else for two or three hours ; till the fit wearing \\noff, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When \\nI awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak and exceed- \\ning thirsty ; however, as I had no water in my habitation, I \\nwas forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again. In \\nthis second sleep, I had this terrible dream : I thought that I \\nwas sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall, where I \\nsat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw \\na man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of \\nfire, and light upon the ground : he was all over as bright as a \\nflame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him: his \\ncountenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for \\nwords to describe ; when he stepped upon the ground with his \\n\\n\\n\\n76 K0B1NS0N CRUSOE. \\n\\nfeet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before \\nin the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my apprehension, \\nas if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He was no sooner \\nlanded upon the earth, but he moved forward towards me, with \\na long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me ; and when he \\ncame to a rising ground at some distance, he spoke to me — \\nor I heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express \\nthe terror of it. All that I can say I understood, was this : — \\n\" Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance, \\nnow thou shalt die;\" at which words, I thought he lifted \\nup the spear that was in his hand to kill me. \\n\\nNo one that shall ever read this account will expect that I \\nshould be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this \\nterrible vision. I mean, that even while it was a dream, I \\n■even dreamed of those horrors. Nor is it any more possible \\nto describe the impression that remained upon my mind when \\nI awaked, and found it was but a dream. \\n\\nI had, alas ! no divine knowledge. What I had received \\nby the good instruction of my father was then worn out by \\nan uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wicked- \\nness, and a constant conversation with none but such as were, \\nlike myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not \\nremember that I had, in all that time, one thought that so \\nmuch as tended either to looking upwards towards God, or \\ninwards towards a reflection upon my own ways ; but a certain \\nstupidity of soul, without desire of good, or conscience of evil, \\nhad entirely overwhelmed me ; and I was all that the most \\nhardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our common \\nsailors can be supposed to be : not having the least sense, \\neither of the fear of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to \\nGod, in deliverance. \\n\\nIt is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my \\nship\\'s crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with \\na kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the \\ngrace of God assisted, might have come up to true thankful- \\nness ; but it ended where it began, in a mere common flight \\n■of joy, without the least reflection upon the distinguished \\ngoodness of the hand which had preserved me, and had singled \\nme out to be preserved when all the rest were destroyed. \\nEven Avhen I was, afterwards, on duo consideration, made \\nsensible of my condition, how I was cast on this dreadful \\n\\n\\n\\nIJOUlJN\\'riOX CItUSOE. / I \\n\\nplace, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of \\nrelief, or prospect of redemption, as scon as I saw but a pros- \\npect of living, and that I should not starve and perish for \\nhunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off; and I began \\nto be very easy, applied myself to the works proper for my \\npreservation and supply, and was far enough from being \\nafflicted at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as \\nthe hand of God against me : these were thoughts which very \\nseldom entered my head. \\n\\nBut to return to my Journal : — \\n\\nJune 28. — Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep \\nI had had, and the>fit being entirely off, I got up ; and though \\nthe fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I con- \\nsidered that the fit of the ague would return again the next \\nday, and now was my time to get something to refresh and \\nsupport myself when I should be ill ; and the first thing I did, \\nI filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set it upon \\nmy table, in reach of my bed ; and to take off the chill or \\naguish disposition of the Avater, I put about a quarter of a. \\npint of rum into it, and mixed them together. Then I got \\nme a piece of the goat\\'s flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but \\ncould eat very little. I walked about, but was very weak,, \\nand withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my \\nmiserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper the \\nnext day. At night, I made my supper of three of the turtle\\'s \\neggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and ate in the shell, and \\nthis was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God\\'s blessing: \\nto, that I could remember, in my whole life. After I had \\neaten, I tried to walk, but found myself so weak, that I could \\nhardly carry a gun, for I never went out without that, so I \\nwent but a little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking \\nout upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm \\nand smooth. Some such thoughts as these occurred to me : \\nGod knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition ; \\nand if nothing happens without His appointment, He has ap- \\npointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to my thought \\nto contradict any of these conclusions, and therefore it rested \\nupon me with the greater force, that it must needs be that \\nGod had appointed all this to befall me ; that I was brought \\ninto this miserable circumstance by His direction, He having \\nthe sole power, not of me only, but of everything that hap- \\n\\n\\n\\n78 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\npened in the world. Immediately it followed — Why has Grod \\ndone this to me ? What have I done to be thus used ? My \\nconscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had \\nblasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice, \\n\" Wretch ! dost thou ask what thou hast done ? Look back \\nupon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself, what thou hast \\nnot done ? Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago de- \\nstroyed ? Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Eoads ; \\nkilled in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man- \\nof-war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa ; \\nor drowned here, when all the crew perished but thyself? \\nDost thou aslc, what have I done 2\" I was struck dumb with \\nthese reflections, as one astonished, and had not a word to say \\n— no, not to answer to myself, but rose up pensive and sad, \\nwalked back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I \\nhad been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly dis- \\nturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep : so I sat down in \\nmy chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, \\nas the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified \\nme very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brazilians \\ntake no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers, and \\nI had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which \\nwas quite cured, and some also that was green, and not quite \\ncured. \\n\\nI went, directed by Heaven no doubt, for in this chest I \\nfound a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and \\nfound what I looked for, the tobacco : and as the few books I \\nhad saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I \\nmentioned before, and which to this time I had not found \\nleisure, or inclination, to look into. What use to make of the \\ntobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or whether it was good \\nfor it or no ; but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was \\nresolved it should hit one way or other. I first took a piece \\nof leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which, indeed, at first, \\nalmost stupified my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, \\nand that I had not been much used to. Then I took some \\nand steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to \\ntake a dose of it when I L\\'y down ; and, lastly, I burnt some \\nupon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of \\nit as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat, as almost for \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 \\n\\nsuffocation. In the interval of this operation, I took up the \\nBible and began to read, but my head was too much disturbed \\nwith the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time: \\nonly, having opened the book casually, the first words that \\noccurred to me were these, \" Gall on me in the day of trouble, \\nand I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.\" These \\nwords were very apt to my case, and made some impression \\nupon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so \\nmuch as they did afterwards ; for, as for being delivered, the \\nword had no sound, as I may say, to me ; the thing was so \\nremote, so impossible in my apprehension of tilings, that I \\nbegan to say as the children of Israel did when they were \\npromised flesh to eat, \" Can God spread a table in the wilder- \\nness 1\" so I began to say, \" Can God Himself deliver me from this \\nplace?\" And as it was not for many years that any hopes ap- \\npeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but however, \\nthe words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon \\nthem very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had dozed \\nmy head so much that I inclined to sleep ; so I left my lamp \\nburning in the cave, lest I should want anything in the night, \\nand went to bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never \\nhad done in all my life ; I kneeled down, and prayed to God, \\nto fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon Him in the \\nday of trouble, He would deliver me. After my broken and \\nimperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had \\nsteeped the tobacco; which was so strong and rank of the \\ntobacco, that I could scarcely get it down ; immediately upon \\nthis I went to bed. I found presently it flew up into my head \\nviolently ; but I fell into a sound sleep, and wuked no more \\ntill, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o\\'clock in \\nthe afternoon the next clay ; nay, to this hour I am partly of \\nopinion, that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost \\nthree the day after : for otherwise, I know not how I should \\nlose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it \\nappeared some years after I had done ; for if I had lost it by \\ncrossing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more than \\none day ; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never \\nknew which way. Be that, however, one way or the other, \\nwhen I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my \\nspirits lively and cheerful ; when I got up, I was stronger than \\n\\n\\n\\n80 EOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nI was the day before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry ; \\nand, in short, I had no fit the next day, but continued much \\naltered for the better. This was the 29th. \\n\\nThe 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad \\nwith my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a \\nsea-fowl or two, something like a brand goose, and brought \\nthem home ; but was not very forward to eat them ; so I ate \\nsome more of the turtle\\'s eggs, which were very good. This \\nevening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did \\nme good the day before, the tobacco steeped in rum ; only I \\ndid not take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, \\nor hold my head over the smoke ; however, I was not so well \\nthe next day, which was the 1st of July, as I hoped I should \\nhave been ; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was \\nnot much. \\n\\nJuly 2. — I renewed the medicine all the three ways ; and \\ndosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity \\nwhich I drank. \\n\\nJuly 3. — I missed the fit for good and all, though I did \\nnot recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I \\nwas thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon \\nthis scripture, \"I will deliver thee;\" and the impossibility of \\nmy deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever \\nexpecting it; but as I was discouraging myself with such \\nthoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon \\nmy deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the \\ndeliverance I had received ; and I was, as it were, made to ask \\nmyself such questions as these, viz : Have I not been delivered, \\nand wonderfully too, from sickness? from the most distressed \\ncondition that could be, and that was so frightful to me ? and \\nwhat notice had I taken of it ? Had I done my part ? God \\nhad delivered me, but I had not glorified Him ; that is to say, \\nI had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance : \\nand how could I expect greater deliverance ? This touched \\nmy heart very much ; and immediately I knelt down, and \\ngave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my sickness. \\n\\nJuly 4. — In the morning, I took the Bible ; and beginning \\nat the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and \\nimposed upon myself to read awhile every morning and every \\nnight ; not tying myself to the number of chapters, but as long \\na3 my -thoughts should engage me. It was not long after I set \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CEUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n81 \\n\\n\\n\\nseriously to this work, till I found my heart more deeply and \\nsincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life. The \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFAQE 120. \\n\\n\\n\\nimpression of my dream revived ; and the words, \" All these \\nthings have not brought thee to repentance,\" ran seriously in \\nmy thoughts. I was earnnsHv w.-<v;..~ ~* Q 0< X to give rue \\n\\n\\n\\n82 BOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nrepentance, when it happened providentially, the very day \\nthat, reading the Scripture, I came to these words, \" He is \\nexalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and to give \\nremission.\" I threw down the book; and with my heart as \\nwell as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of \\n\\'joy, I cried out aloud, \" Jesus, thou son of David ! Jesus, thou \\nexalted Prince and Saviour! give me repentance !\" This was \\nthe first time I could say, in the true sense of the words, that \\nI prayed in all my life ; for now I prayed with a sense of my \\ncondition, and with a true scripture view of hope, founded on \\nthe encouragement of the word of God; and from this time, I \\nmay say, I began to have hope that God would hear me. \\n\\nNow I began to construe the words mentioned above, \" Call \\non Me, and I will deliver thee,\" in a different slnsc from what \\nI had ever done before ; for then I had no notion of anything \\nbeing called deliverance, but my being delivered from the cap- \\ntivity I was in : for though I was indeed at large in the place, \\nyet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the \\nworst sense in the world. But now I learned to take it in \\nanother sense : now I looked back upon my past life with such \\nhorror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought \\nnothing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt that \\nbore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was \\nnothing ; I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, \\nor think of it ; it was all of no consideration in comparison \\nto this. And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall \\nread it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things, they \\nwill find deliverance from sin a, much greater blessing than \\ndeliverance from affliction. \\n\\nBut, leaving this part, I return to my Journal : — \\nFrom the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed \\nin walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little \\nat a time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a \\nfit of sickness : for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, \\nand to what weakness I was reduced. The application which \\nI made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps which had never \\ncured an ague before ; neither can I recommend it to anyone \\nto practise by this experiment : and though it did carry off \\nthe fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening me; for I had \\nfrequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time ; I \\nlearned from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in the \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 \\n\\nrainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that \\ncould be, especially in those rains which came attended with \\nstorms and hurricanes of wind ; for as the rain which came \\nthe dry season was almost always accompanied with such storms, \\nso I found that rain was much more dangerous than the fain \\nwhich fell in September and October. \\n\\nI had now been in this unhappy island above ten mouths : \\nall possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed t be \\nentirely taken from me ; and I firmly believed that no hu lan \\nshape had ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured \\nmy habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a gre t \\ndesire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to \\nsee what otheftproductions I might find, which I yet knew \\nnothing of. \\n\\nIt was on th-3 15th of July that I began to take a more \\nparticular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek \\nfirst, where I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I \\ncame about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher ; \\nand that it was no more than a little brook of running water, \\nvery fresh and good ; but this being the dry season, there was \\nhardly any water in some parts of it. On the banks of this \\nbrook, I found many pleasaut savannahs or meadows, plain, \\nsmooth, and covered with grass: and on the rising parts of \\nthem, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as might \\nbe supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, \\ngreen, and growing to a great and very strong stalk ; there \\nwere divers otli€r plants, which I had no notion of or under- \\nstanding about, that might perhaps, have virtues of their own, \\nwhich I could not find out. I searched for the cassava root, \\nwhich the Indians, in all that climate, make their bread of, but \\nI could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not \\nunderstand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild, and \\nfor want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with \\nthese discoveries for this time, and came back, musing with \\nmyself what course I might take to know the virtue and good- \\nness of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover ; \\nbut could bring it to no conclusion ; for, in short, I had made \\nso little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew \\nlittle of the plants in the field, that might serve me to any \\npurpose now in my distress. \\n\\nThe next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again ; and \\n\\n\\n\\n84: BOBINSON CHUSOE. \\n\\nafter going something farther than I had gone the day before, \\nI found the brook and savannahs cease, and the country- \\nbecame more woody. In this part, I found different fruits, and \\nparticularly melons upon the ground, in great abundance, and \\ngrapes upon the trees ; the vines had spread over the trees,, \\nand the clusters of grapes were just now in their prime, very \\nripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was \\nexceeding glad of them ; but I was warned by my experience \\nto eat sparingly of them, remembering that when I was ashore \\nin Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our English- \\nmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and \\nfevers. But I found an excellent use for these grapes ; and \\nthat was, to cure or dry them in the sun, andr*keep them as \\ndried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be \\n\"wholesome and agreeable to eat, when no grapes could be \\nhad. \\n\\nI spent all that evening there, and went not back to my \\nhabitation, which, by the way, was the first night, as I might \\nsay, I had lain from home. In the night, I took my fir^t con- \\ntrivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well ; and the \\nnext morning, proceeded upon my discovery, travelling nearly \\nfour miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley, keep- \\ning still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north \\nside of me. At the end of this march, I came to an opening, \\nwhere the country seemed to descend to the west ; and a \\nlittle spring of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the \\nhill by me, ran the other way ; and the country appeared so \\nfresh, so green, so flourishing, everything being in a constant \\nverdure, that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a \\nlittle on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a \\nkind of secret pleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting \\nthoughts, that this was all my own ; that I was king and lord \\nof all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of possession; \\nand, if I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance as com- \\npletely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here \\nabundance of cocoa trees, orange and lemon, and citron trees; \\nbut all wild, and very few bearing any fruit. However, the \\ngreen limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, \\nbut very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with \\n\"water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and re- \\nfreshing. I found now I had business enough, to gather and \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 8i> \\n\\ncarry home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of \\ngrapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, \\nwhich I knew was approaching. In order to do this, I \\ngathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in \\nanother place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in another \\nplace ; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled home- \\nwards : and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or sack,, \\nor what I could make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, \\nhaving spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I \\nmust now call my tent and my cave), but before I got thither \\nthe grapes were spoiled ; the richness of the fruit, and the \\nweight of the juice, having broken them and bruised them, \\nthey were good for little or nothing : as to the limes, they \\nwere good, but I could bring but a few. \\n\\nThe next day being the 19th, I went back, having made me \\ntwo small bags to bring home my harvest ; but I was surprised, \\nwhen coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and \\nfine when I gathered them, I found them all spread about, trod \\nto pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and \\nabundance eaten and devoured. By this, I concluded there \\nwere some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this ; \\nbut what they were, I knew not. However, as I found there \\nwas no laying them up on heaps, and no carrying them away \\nin a sack, but that one way they would be destroyed, and the \\nother way they would be crushed with their own weight, I took \\nanother course ; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, \\nand hung them upon the out branches of the trees, that they \\nmight cure and dry in the sun ; and as for the limes and the \\nlemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand under. \\n\\nWhen I came home from this journey, I contemplated with \\ngreat pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasant- \\nness of the situation ; the security from storms on that side \\nthe water, and the wood : and concluded that I had pitched \\nupon a place to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part \\nof the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of re- \\nmoving my habitation ; and looking out for a place equally \\nsafe as where now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, \\nfruitful part of the island. \\n\\nThis thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding \\nfond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting \\nme ; but when I came to a nearer view of it, I considered that \\n\\n\\n\\n86 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nI was now by the sea side, where it was at least possible that \\nsomething might happen to my advantage ; and, by the same \\nill fate that brouerht mo hither, might brino; some other un- \\nhappy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce \\nprobable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to inclose \\nmyself among the hills and woods in the centre of the island, \\nwas to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an affair \\nnot only improbable, but impossible; and that therefore I \\nought not by any means to remove. However, I was so en- \\namoured of this place, that I spent much of my time there for \\nthe whole of the remaining part of the month of July, and \\nthough, upon second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I \\nbuilt me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a \\ndistance with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as \\nI could reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood ; \\nand here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights \\ntogether ; always going over it with a ladder ; so that I fancied \\nnow I had my country house and my sea-coast house ; and this \\nwork took me up to the beginning of August. \\n\\nI had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my \\nlabour, when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my \\nfirst habitation ; for though I had made me a tent like the \\nother, with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had \\nnot the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave \\nbehind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary. \\n\\nAbout the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my \\nbower and began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August, I found \\nthe grapes I had hung up perfectly dried, and indeed were \\nexcellent good raisins ; so I began to take them down from the \\ntrees, and it was very happy that I did so, for the rains which \\nfollowed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part \\nof my winter food; for I had above two hundred large bunches \\nof them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried \\nmost of them home to my cave, but it began to rain ; and \\nfrom hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or \\nless, every day till the middle of October ; and sometimes so \\nviolently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several \\ndays. \\n\\nIn this season, I was much surprised with the increase of \\nmy family : I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, \\n•who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 87 \\n\\nI heard no more tidings of her, till to my astonishment, she \\ncame home about the end of August, with three kittens. This \\nwas the more strange to me, because, though I had killed a \\n■wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a \\nquite different kind from our European cats ; but the young \\ncats were the same kind of house-breed as the old one ; and \\nboth my cats being females, I thought it very strange. But \\nfrom these three cats, I afterwards came to be so pestered with \\ncats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, \\nand to drive them from my house as much as possible. \\n\\nFrom the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so \\nthat I could not stir, and was now very careful not ro be much \\nwet. In this confinement, I began to be straitened for food : \\nbut venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat ; and the last \\nday, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which \\nwas a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus : — I ate a \\nbunch of raisins for my breakfast ; a piece of the goat\\'s flesh, or \\nof the turtle, for my dinner, broiled, for I had no vessel to boil \\nor stew anything ; and two or three of the turtle\\'s eggs for \\nmy supper. \\n\\nDuring this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked \\ndaily two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees \\nworked it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of \\nthe hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond \\nmy fence or wall ; and so I came in and out this way. But I \\nwas not perfectly easy at lying so open ; for, as I had managed \\nmyself before, I was in a perfect enclosure ; whereas now, I \\nthought I lay exposed, and open for anything to come in upon \\nme; and yet I could not perceive that there was any living \\nthing to fear, the biggest creature that I had yet seen upon the \\nisland being a goat. \\n\\nSept. 30. — I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of \\nmy landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and found I \\nhad been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept \\nthis day as a solemn fast, even till the going down of the sun; \\nI then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to \\nbed , finishing the day as I began it, with religious exercise. \\nI had all this time observed uo Sabbath-day ; for as at first I \\nhad no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, \\nomitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch \\nthan ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know \\n\\n\\n\\n88 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nwhat any of the days were ; but now, having cast up the days \\nas above, I found I had been there a year, so I divided it into \\nweeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath ; though \\nI found at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two in \\nmy reckoning. A little after this, my ink began to fail me, \\nand so I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to \\nwrite down only the most remarkable events of my life, without \\ncontinuing a daily memorandum of other things. \\n\\nThe rainy season and the dry season now began to appear \\nregular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide \\nfor them accordingly ; but I bought all my experience before \\nI had it, and this I am going to relate was one of the most \\ndiscouraging experiments that I made. \\n\\nI have mentioned that I had saved the few cars of barley \\nand rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I \\nthought of themselves, and I believe there were about thirty \\nstalks of rice, and about twenty of barley ; and now I thought \\nit a proper time to sow it, after the rains, the sun being in its \\nsouthern position, going from me. Accordingly, I dug up a \\npiece of ground as well as I could with my wooden spade, and \\ndividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain ; but as I was \\nsowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not \\nsow it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper \\ntime for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving \\nabout a handful of each. It was a great comfort to me after- \\nwards that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this \\ntime came to anything ; for the dry months following, the earth \\nhaving had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture \\nto assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet season \\nhad come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly \\nsown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily \\nimagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of \\nground to make another trial in, and I dug up a piece of \\nground near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in \\nFebruary, a little before the vernal equinox ; and this having the \\nrainy months of March and April to water it, sprung up very \\npleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of \\nthe seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had \\nbut a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to \\nhalf a peck of each kind. But by this experiment T was made \\nmaster of my business, and knew exactly when the proper \\n\\n\\n\\no \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n89 \\n\\n\\n\\nseason was to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times \\nand two harvests every year. \\n\\nWhile this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which \\nwas of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nr.iGii l-\\'-l. \\n\\n\\n\\nand the weather began to settle, which was about the month \\nof November, I made a visit up the country to my bower, \\nwhere, though I had not been some months, yet I found all \\nthings just as I left them. The circle or double hedge \\nthat I had made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes \\nwhich I had cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts, were \\n\\n\\n\\n90 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nall shot out and grown with long branches, as much as a willow- \\ntree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head. I \\nwas surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young \\ntrees grow ; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as \\nmuch alike as I could ; and it is scarce credible how beautiful \\na figure they grew into in three years ; so that though the \\nedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet \\nthe trees soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient \\nto lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to \\ncut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a \\nsemi-circle round the wall of my first dwelling, which I did ; \\nand placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight \\nyards distance from my first fence, they grew presently, and \\nwere at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards \\nserved for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order. \\n\\nI found now that the seasons of the year might generally \\nbe divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but \\ninto the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were \\ngenerally thus : — \\n\\nThe half of February, the whole of March, and the \\nhalf of April — rainy, the sun being then on or near the \\nequinpx. \\n\\nThe half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and \\nthe half of August — dry, the sun being then to the north of \\nthe Line. \\n\\nThe half of August, the whole of September, and the half \\nof October — rainy, the sun being then come back. \\n\\nThe half of October, the whole of November, December, and \\nJanuary, and the half of February — dry, the sun being then \\nto the south of the Line. \\n\\nThe rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter, as the \\nwinds happened to blow, but this was the general observation \\nI made. After I had found, by experience, the ill conse- \\nquences of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish \\nmyself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be obliged \\nto go out, and I sat within doors as much as possible during \\nthe wet months. This time I found much employment, and \\nvery suitable also to the time, for I found great occasion for \\nmany things which I had no way to furnish myself with but \\nby hard labour and constant application ; particularly I tried \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 91 \\n\\nmany ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could \\nget for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do \\nnothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that \\nwhen I was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at \\na basket-maker\\'s, in the town where my father lived, to see \\nthem make their wicker-ware ; and being, as boys usually are, \\nvery officious to help, and a great observer of the manner in \\nwhich they worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I \\nhad by these means full knowledge of the methods of it, and I \\nwanted nothing but the materials, when it came into my mind \\nthat the twigs of that tree whence I cut my stakes that grew \\nmight possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows, and osiers \\nin England, asd I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day \\nI went to my country-house, as I called it, and cutting some \\nof the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as \\nI could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared \\nwith a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for \\nthere was great plenty of them. These I set up to dry within \\nmy circle or hedge, and when they were fit for use, I carried \\nthem to my cave ; and here, during the next season, I employed \\nmyself in making, as well as I could, a great many baskets, \\nboth to carry or to lay up anything, as I had occasion ; and \\nthough I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made \\nthem sufficiently serviceable for my purpose ; and thus, after- \\nwards, I took care never to be without them; and as my \\nwicker-Avare decayed, I made more, especially strong deep \\nbaskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should \\ncome to have any quantity of it. \\n\\nHaving mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of \\ntime about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to \\nsupply two wants. I had no vessel to hold anything that was \\nliquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and \\nsome glass bottles — some of the common size, and others, which \\nwere case-bottles, square, for the holding of waters, spirits, \\n&c. I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except a \\ngreat kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was too \\nbig to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The \\nsecond thing I fain would have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it \\nwas impossible to make one; however, I found a contrivance \\nfor that, too, at last. I employed myself in planting my \\n\\n\\n\\n92 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nsecond rows of stakes or piles and in this wicker-working all \\nthe summer or dry season, when another business took me up \\nmore time than it could be imagined I could spare. \\n\\nI mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole \\nisland, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to \\nwhere I built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to \\nthe sea, on the other side of the island. I now resolved to \\ntravel quite across to the sea-shore on that side ; so, taking \\nmy gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of \\npowder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great \\nbunch of raisins in my pouch for my store, I began my journey. \\n\"When I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, \\nI came within view of the sea to the west, and it being a very \\nclear day, I fairly descried land, at a very great distance ; \\nby my guess, it could not be less than fifteen or twenty \\nleagues off. \\n\\nI could not tell what part of the world this might be, other- \\nwise than that I knew it must be part of America, and, as I con- \\ncluded, by all my observations, must be near the Spanish \\ndominions. \\n\\nAfter some thought upon this affair, I considered that if \\nthis land was the Spanish coast, I should certainty, one time \\nor other, see some vessel pass or repass one way or other ; but \\nif not, then it was the savage coast between the Spanish \\ncountry and Brazils, where are found the worst of savages. \\n\\nWith these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward ; \\nI found that side of the island where I now was much plea- \\nsanter than mine — the savannah fields sweet, adorned with \\nflowers and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw \\nabundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught one, if \\npossible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak \\nto me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young \\nparrot, for I knocked it down with a stick, and having re- \\ncovered it, I brought it home ; but it was some years before I \\ncould make him speak ; however, at last, I taught him to call \\nme by my name very familiarly. But the accident that followed, \\nthough it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place. \\n\\nI was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in \\nthe low grounds hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes? \\nbut they differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met \\nwith, nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed \\n\\n\\n\\nROBIXSON CUUSOE. OO \\n\\nseveral. But I had no need to be venturous, for I had no want \\nof food, and of that which was very good, too, especially these \\nthree sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise, which, \\nadded to my grapes, Leadenhall-market could not have fur- \\nnished a table better than I, in proportion to the company. \\n\\nI never travelled in this journey above two miles outright \\nin a day, or thereabouts ; but I took so many turns to see \\nwhat discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to \\nthe place where I resolved to sit down all night ; and then I \\neither reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a \\nrow of stakes set upright in the ground, from one tree \\nto another, so as no wild creature could come at me without \\nwaking me. \\n\\nAs soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see \\nthat I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island, \\nfor here, indeed, the shore was covered with innumerable turtles, \\nwhereas, on the other side I had found but three in a year and \\na half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many \\nkinds, some I had seen, and some I had not seen before, and \\nmany of them very good meat, but such as I knew not the \\nnames of, except those called penguins. \\n\\nI could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing \\nof my powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill \\na she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on ; and \\nthough there were many goats here, more than on my side the \\nisland, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come \\nnear them, the country being flat and even, and they saw me \\nmuch sooner than when I was on the hill. \\n\\nI confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than \\nmine : but yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as \\nI was fixed in my habitation it became natural to me, and I \\nseemed all the while I was here to be as it were upon a journey, \\nand from home. However, I travelled along the shore of the \\nsea towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles, and then \\nsetting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded \\nI would go home again, and that the next journey I took \\nshould be on the other side of the island east from my dwelling, \\nand so round till I came to my post again. \\n\\nI took another way to come back than that I went, thinking \\nI could easily keep all the island so much in my view, that I \\ncould not miss finding my dwelling by viewing the country; \\n\\n\\n\\n94: ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nbut I found myself mistaken, for, being come about two or, \\nthree miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley, \\nbut so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with wood \\nthat I could not see which was my way by any direction but \\nthat of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the \\nposition of the sun at that time of the day. It happened, to \\nmy further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three \\nor four days while I was in the valley, and not being able to \\nsee the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last \\nwas obliged to find the sea-side, look for my post, and come \\nback the same way I went; and then by easy journeys I turned \\nhomeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, \\nammunition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy. \\n\\nIn this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized \\nupon it, and I, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and \\nsaved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it \\nhome if I could, for I had often been musing whether it might \\nnot be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame \\ngoats, which might supply me when my powder and shot should \\nbe all spent. I made a collar for this little creature, and with \\na string, which. I made of some rope-yarn, which I always \\ncarried about with me, I led him along, though with some \\ndifficulty, till I came to my bower, and there I inclosed him \\nand left him, for I was very impatient to be at home, whence \\nI had been absent above a month. \\n\\nI cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come \\ninto my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This \\nlittle wandering journey, without settled place of abode, had \\nbeen so unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to \\nmyself, was a perfect settlement to me compared to that; and \\nit rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I resolved \\nI would never go a great way from it again, while it should be \\nmy lot to stay on the island. \\n\\nI reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself \\nafter my long journey ; during which, most of the time was \\ntaken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, \\nwho began now to be a mere domestic, and to be well \\nacquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid \\nwhich I had penned in within my little circle, and resolved to \\ngo and fetch it home, or give it some food; accordingly I went, \\nand found it where I left it, almost starved for want of food. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 \\n\\nI went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of suclf\\'shrubs \\nas I could find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it \\nas I did before, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being \\nhungry, that I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me \\nlike a dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature became so \\nloving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that \\ntime one of my domestics also, and would never leave me \\nafterwards. \\n\\nThe rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, \\nand I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner \\nas before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island, \\nhaving now been there two years, and no more prospect of \\nbeing delivered than the first day I came there. \\n\\nIt was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more \\nhappy this life I now led was, with all its miserable circum- \\nstances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the \\npast part of my days ; and now I changed both my sorrows \\nand my joys; my very desires altered, my affections changed \\ntheir gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from what they \\nwere at my first coming, or, indeed, for the two years past. \\n\\nI began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I daily read \\nthe word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my \\npresent state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the \\nBible upon these words, \"I will never, never leave thee, nor \\nforsake thee;\" immediately it occurred that these words were \\nto me ; why else should they be directed in such a manner, \\njust at the moment when I was mourning over my condition, \\nas one forsaken of God and man? \"Well then,\" said I, \"if \\nGod does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, \\nor what matters it, though the world should all forsake me, \\nseeing on the other hand, if I had all the world, and should \\nlose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no \\ncomparison in the loss.\" \\n\\nFrom this moment I began to conclude in my mind, that it \\nwas possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary \\ncondition, than it was probable I should ever have been in any \\nother particular state in the world; and with this thought I \\nwas going to give thanks to God f iv bringing me to this place. \\nI know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at \\nthat thought, and I durst not speak the words. \" How canst \\nthou become such a hypocrite,\" said I, even audibly, \" to pre- \\n\\n\\n\\n9C ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ntend to be thankful for a condition, which, however thou \\nmayest endeavour to be contented with, thou wouldst rather \\npray heartily to be delivered from ?\" So I stopped there, but \\nthough I could not say I thanked God for being there, yet I \\nsincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by what- \\never afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my \\nlife, and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never \\nopened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me \\nblessed God for directing my friend in England, without any \\norder of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assist- \\ning me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship. \\n\\nIn this disposition of mind, I began my third year ; and \\nthough I have not given the reader the trouble of so parti- \\ncular an account of my works this year as the first; yet in \\ngeneral it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle, but \\nhaving regularly divided my time according to the several \\ndaily employments that were before me, such as, first, my duty \\nto God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set \\napart some time for, thrice every day; secondly, the going \\nabroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up three \\nhours in every morning, when it did not rain : thirdly, the \\nordering, cutting, preserving, and cooking, what I had killed \\nor caught for my supply : these took up great part of the day; \\nalso, it is to be considered, that in the middle of the day, when \\nthe sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too \\ngreat to stir out ; so that about four hours in the evening was \\nall the time I could be supposed to work in, with this \\nexception, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and \\nworking, and went to work in the morning, and abroad with \\nmy gun in the afternoon. \\n\\nTo this short time for labour, may be added the exceeding \\nlaboriousness of my work ; the many hours which for want of \\ntools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up \\nout of my time : for example, I was full two and forty days in \\nmaking a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave ; \\nwhereas, two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would \\nhave cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day. \\n\\nMy case was this : it was to be a large tree which was to be \\ncut down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree \\nI was three days in cutting down, and two more cutting off \\nthe boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With \\n\\n\\n\\nROKIXSON CRUSOE. 97 \\n\\ninexpressible Lacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of \\nit into chip3 till it began to be light enough to move; then I \\nturned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board \\nfrom end to end ; then turning that side downward, cut the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nother side, till I brought the plank to be about three inches \\nthick, and smooth on both sides. Anyone may judge the \\nlabour in such a piece of work, but labour and patience carried \\nme through that, and many other things, as will appear by \\nwhat follows. \\n\\n1 was now, in the months of November and December, ex- \\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\n98 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\npccting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had \\nmanured and dug up for them was not great ; for, as I observed \\nmy seed of each was not above the quantity of half a peck, but \\nnow my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found I \\nwas in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, \\nwhich it was scarcely possible to keep from it; as, first the \\ngoats, and wild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting \\nthe sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as \\nit came up, and ate it so close, that it could get no time to \\nshoot up into stalk. \\n\\nThis I saw no remedy for, but by making an enclosure about \\nit with a hedge ; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the \\nmore, because it required speed. However, as my arable land \\nwas but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced \\nin about three weeks\\' time ; and shooting some of the creatures \\nin the day-time, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying \\nhim up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark \\nall night long; so in a little time, the enemies forsook the \\nplace, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to \\nripen apace. \\n\\nBut as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in \\nthe blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it \\nwas in the car ; for going along by the place to see how it throve, \\nI saw my little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not how \\nmany sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I should be \\ngone. I immediately let fly among them, for I always had my \\ngun with me. I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little \\ncloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the \\ncorn itself. \\n\\nThis touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days \\nthey would devour all my hopes ; that I should be starved, and \\nnever be able to raise a crop at all, and what to do I could not \\ntell; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, \\nthough I should watch it night and day. In the first place, I \\nwent among it, to see what damage was already done, and \\nfound they had spoiled a good deal of it ; but that as it was yet \\ntoo green for them, the loss was not so great, but that the \\nremainder was likely to bo a good crop, if it could be saved. \\n\\nI stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I \\ncouhl easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, \\n\\n\\n\\nROEIXSON CRUSOE. 99 \\n\\nas if they only waited till I was gone away, and the event \\nproved it to be so ; for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was \\nno sooner out of their sight, than they dropped clown one by \\none into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not \\nhave patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every \\ngrain that they ate now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf \\nto me in the consequence ; but coming up to the hedge I fired \\nagain, and killed three of them. This was what I wished for ; \\nso I took them up, and served them as we serve notorious \\nthieves in England — hanged them in chains, for a terror to \\nothers. It is impossible to imagine that this should have such \\nan effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not come at \\nthe corn, but, inshort, theyforsook all that part of the island, and \\nI could never see a bird near the place as long as my scare- \\ncrows hung there. This I was very glad of, and about the \\nlatter end of December, which was our second harvest of the \\nyear, I reaped my corn. \\n\\nI was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, \\nand all I could do was to make one, as well as I could, out of \\none of the broad-swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among \\nthe arms out of the ship. However, as my first crop was but \\nsmall, I had no great difficulty to cut it down; in short, I \\nreaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the cars, and \\ncarried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so \\nrubbed it out with my hands ; and at the end of my harvesting, \\nI found that out of my half-peck of seed I had near two bushels \\nof rice, and about two bushels and a half of barley ; that is to \\nsay, by my guess, for I had no measure at that time. \\n\\nHowever, this was a great encouragement to me, and I fore- \\nsaw that, in time, it would please God to supply me with bread: \\nand yet, here I was perplexed again, for I neither knew how \\nto grind or make meal of my corn, or, indeed, how to clean it \\nand part it ; nor, if made into meal, how to make broad of it : \\nand if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it ; I re- \\nsolved not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for \\nseed against the next season ; and, in the meantime, to employ \\nall my study and hours of working to accomplish this great \\nwork of providing myself with corn and bread. \\n\\nIt might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. I \\nbelieve few people have thought much upon the strange multi- \\n\\n\\n\\n100 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\niude of little tilings necessary in the providing, producing, \\ncuring, dressing, making, and finishing this one article of \\nbread. \\n\\nI, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to \\nmy daily discouragement, and was made more sensible of it \\nevery hour. \\n\\nFirst, I had no plough to turn up the earth ; no spade or \\nshovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making me a \\nwooden spade, as I observed before, but this did my work but \\nin a wooden manner, and though it cost me a great many days \\nto make it, yet for want of iron, it not only wore out soon, but \\nmade my work the harder, and made it be performed much \\nworse. However, this I bore with, and was content to work \\nit out with patience, and bear with the badness of the per- \\nformance. When the corn was sown, I had no harrow, but \\nwas forced to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy bough \\nof a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be called, rather than \\nrake or harrow it. When it was growing, and grown, I have \\nobserved already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure \\nit, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from \\nthe chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves \\nto dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven \\nto bake it, but all these things I did without, as shall be ob- \\nserved ; and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort am \\nadvantage to me, too. All this made everything laborious an \\ntedious to me, but that there was no help for; neither was my \\ntime so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain \\npart of it was every day appointed to these works ; and as I had \\nresolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater \\nquantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself \\nwholly, by labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils \\nproper for the performing all the operations necessary for \\nmaking the corn, when I had it, fit for my use. \\n\\nBut first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed \\nenough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I \\nhad a week\\'s work at least to make mo a spade, which, when it \\nwas done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and \\nrequired double labour to work with it. However, I got \\nthrough that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of \\nground, as near my house as i could find them to my mind, \\nand fenced them in with a good hedg 1 \\', the stakes of which \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 10L \\n\\nwere all cut of that wood which I had set before, and knew it \\nwould grow ; so that, in one year\\'s time, I knew I should have \\na quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair. \\nThis work did not take mo up less than three months, because \\na great part of that time was the wet season, when I could not \\ngo abroad. Within doors I found employment in the following \\n-occupations — always observing, that all the while I was at \\nwork, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and teaching \\nliim to speak; and I quickly taught him to know his own name, \\nand at last to speak it out pretty loud, Poll, which was the first \\nword I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my \\nown. This, therefore, was not my work, but an assistance to \\nmy work, for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon, \\nmy hands, as follows: I had long studied to make, by some \\nmeans or other, some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I wanted \\nsorely, but knew not where to come at them. However, con- \\nsidering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could \\nfind out any clay, I might make some pots that might, being \\ndried in the sun, be hard enough and strong enough to bear \\nhandling, and to hold anything that was dry, and required to \\nbe kept so ; and as this was necessary in the preparing corn, \\nmeal, &c, which was the thing I was doing, I resolved to make \\nsome as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold \\nwhat should be put into them. \\n\\nIt would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, \\nto tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste ; \\nwhat odd, misshapen, ugly things I made; how many of them \\nfell in, and how many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough \\nto bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent \\nheat of the sun, being set out too hastily ; and how many fell \\nin pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were \\ndried ; and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find \\nthe clay — to dig it, to temper it, to bring ic home, and work \\nit — 1 could not make above two large earthen ugly things (I \\ncannot call them jars) in about two months\\' labour. \\n\\nHowever, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I \\nlifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two \\ngreat wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for them, \\nthat they might not break ; and as between the pot and the \\nbasket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the \\nrice and barley straw; and these two pots being to stand \\n\\n\\n\\n102 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nalways dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps* \\nthe meal, when the corn was bruised. \\n\\nThough I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, \\nyet I made several smaller things with better success ; such as- \\nlittle round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any \\nthings my hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked \\nthem quite hard. \\n\\nBut my end was to get an earthen pot to hold what was \\nliquid, and bear the fire ; which none of these could do. It \\nhappened after some time, making a pretty large fire for cook- \\ning my meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with \\nit, I found a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in \\nthe fire burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was \\nagreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself, that certainly \\nthey might be made to burn whole, if they would burn \\nbroken. \\n\\nThis set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it \\nburn some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters \\nburn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had some lead \\nto do it with ; but I placed three large pipkins, and two or \\nthree pots, in a pile, one xipon another, and placed my firewood \\nall round it with a great heap of embers under them. I plied \\nthe fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the top, \\ntill I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and ob- \\nserved that they did not crack at all ; when I saw them clear \\nred, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I \\nfound one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run ; \\nfor the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the \\nviolence of the heat, and would have run into glass if I had \\ngone on ; so I slacked my fire gradually till the pots began \\nto abate of the red colour, and watching them all night, \\nthat I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I \\nhad three very good (I will not say handsome) pipkins, and \\ntwo other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, \\nand one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the \\nsand. \\n\\nAfter this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort \\nof earthenware for my use ; but as to the shapes of them, they \\nwere very indifferent, as anyone may suppose. \\n\\nNo joy at a tiling of so mean a nature was over equal to \\nmine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would \\n\\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRLEOE. 103 \\n\\nbear the fire ; and I had hardly patience to stay till they were \\ncold, before I set one on the fire again, with some water in it, \\nto boil me some meat, which it did admirably well ; and with \\na piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though I wanted \\noatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it as \\ngood as I would have had it been. \\n\\nMy next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or \\nbeat some corn in ; for as to the mill, there was no thought of \\narriving at that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To \\nsupply this want, I was at a great loss ; for, of all the trades \\nin the world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, \\nas for any whatever ; neither had I any tools to go about it \\nwith. I spent many a day to find out a great stone big \\nenough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could \\nfind none at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which \\nI had no way to dig or cut out ; nor indeed were the rocks \\nin the island of hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy \\ncrumbling stone, which neither would bear the weight of a \\nheavy pestle, nor would break the corn, without filling it with \\nsand ; so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for a \\nstone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great \\nblock of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier ; and \\ngetting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and \\nformed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then, \\nwith the help of fire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place \\nin it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this, \\nI made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called the \\niron-wood ; and this I prepared and laid by against I had my \\nnext crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to grind, or \\nrather pound, into meal, to make bread. \\n\\nMy next difficulty was to make a sieve, to dress my meal, \\nand to part it from the bran and the husk ; without which I \\ndid not see it possible I could have any bread. This was a \\nmost difficult thing, even to think on, for to be sure I had \\nnothing like the necessary thing to make it; I mean fine thin \\ncanvas, or stuff, to scarce the meal through. And here I was \\nat a full stop for many months ; nor did I really know what \\nto do. Linen I had none left, but what was mere rags ; I had \\ngoats\\'-hair, but neither knew how to weave it or spin it ; and \\nhad I known how, here were no tools to work it with. All \\nthe remedy that I found for this was, that at last I did re- \\n\\n\\n\\n104 HOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nmember I had, among the seamen\\'s clothes which were saved \\nout of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin ; and with \\nsome pieces of these I made three small sieves, proper enough \\nfor the work ; and thus I made shift for some years : how \\nI did afterwards, I shall show in its place. \\n\\nThe baking part was the next thing to be considered, and \\nhow I should make bread when I came to have corn ; for, \\nfirst, I had no yeast; as to that part, there was no supplying \\nthe want, so I did not concern myself much about it. But \\nfor an oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length, I found \\nout an experiment for that also, which was this : I made some \\nearthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about \\ntwo feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep ; these I \\nburned in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them by ; \\nand when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon my \\nhearth, which I had paved with some square tiles, of my own \\nbaking and burning also. \\n\\nWhen the fire-wood was burned pretty much into embers, \\nI drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, \\nand there I let them lie till the hearth was very hot; then \\nsweeping away all the embers, I set down loaves, and whelming \\ndown the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers all round \\nthe outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat; and \\nthus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my \\nbarley loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastry-cook \\ninto the bargain ; for I made myself several cakes and puddings \\nof the rice; but I made no pies, neither had I anything to put \\ninto them, except the flesh either of fowls or goats. \\n\\nAll these things took me up most part of the third year of \\nmy abode here ; for. it is to be observed, that in the intervals \\nof these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to \\nmanage ; for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it \\nhome as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in my large \\nbaskets, till I had time to rub it out, for I had no floor to \\nthrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with. \\n\\nA.nd now, my stock of corn increasing, I wanted to build \\nmy barns bigger ; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the in- \\ncrease of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the \\nbarley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more, \\ninsomuch that now I resolved to begin to u.->c it freely ; for \\nmy bread had been quite gone a great while ; also I resolved \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n105 \\n\\n\\n\\nto see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, \\nand to sow but once a-ycar. \\n\\nUpon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley \\nand rice were much more than I could consume in a year ; so \\nI resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nso\\'.vcJ the hut, in hopes that such a quantity would fully pro- \\nviso me with bread, &c. \\n\\nAll the while these things were doing, my thoughts ran \\nmany times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from \\n\\'the other side of the island ; and I was not without secret \\nwishes that I were on shore there, fancying I might find some \\n\\n\\n\\n106 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nway or otherto convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find \\nsome means of escape. \\n\\nNow I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the \\nshoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand \\nmiles on the coast of Africa ; but this was in vain : then I \\nthought I would go and look at our ship\\'s boat, which was \\nblown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, when we \\nwere first cast away. She lay almost where she did at first ; \\nand was turned, by the force of the waves and the winds, \\nalmost bottom upward, but no water about her. If I had had \\nhands to have refitted her, and to have launched her into the \\nwater, the boat would have done well enough, and I might \\nhave gone back into the Brazils with her easily ; but I might \\nhave foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her up- \\nright upon her bottom, than I could remove the island ; how- \\never, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and \\nbrought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could do ; \\nsuggesting to myself, that if 1 could but turn her down, I \\nmight repair the damage she had received, and she would be \\na very good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily. \\n\\nI spared no pains in tin\\'s piece of fruitless toil, and spent \\nthree or four weeks about it ; at last, finding it impossible to \\nheave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the \\nsand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting \\npieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall. \\n\\nBut when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, \\nor to get under it, much less to move it forward towards the \\nwater ; so I was forced to give it over. \\n\\nThis at length put me upon thinking whether it was not \\npossible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the \\nnatives of those climates make, even without tools, of the trunk \\nof a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, \\nand pleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, \\nand with my having much more convenience for it than any \\nof the negroes or Indians ; but not at all considering the par- \\nticular inconveniences which I lay under more than the Indians \\ndid, viz., want of hands to move it, when it was made, into \\nthe water ; for what was it to me, if when I had chosen a vast \\ntree in the woods, and with much trouble cut it down, if I \\nhad been able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into \\nthe proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 107\\' \\n\\nmake it hollow, so as to make a boat of it — if, after all this, I \\nmust leave it just where I found it, and not be able to launch \\nit into the water ? \\n\\nI went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever \\nman did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself \\nwith the design, without determining whether I was ever able \\nto undertake it ; not but that the difficulty of launching my \\nboat came often into my head ; but I put a st. >p to my in- \\nquiries into it, by this foolish answer : \" Let me first make it ; \\nI warrant I will find some way or other to get it along when \\nit is done.\" \\n\\nI felled a cedar-tree, and I question much whether Solomon \\never had such a one for the building of the Temple of Jeru- \\nsalem •, it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part \\nnext the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end \\nof twenty-two feet. It was not without infinite labour that I \\nfelled this tree ; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it \\nat the bottom ; I was fourteen more getting the branches and \\nlimbs cut oft\\', which I hacked and hewed through with axe and \\nhatchet, with inexpressible labour: after this, it cost me a \\nmonth to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to some- \\nthing like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as \\nit ought to do. It cost me near three months more to clear \\nthe inside, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it ; \\nthis I did, without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the \\ndint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very hand- \\nsome periagua, and big enough to have carried six and twenty \\nmen, and consequently big enough to have carried me and all \\nmy cargo. \\n\\nWhen I had gone through this work, I was extremely de- \\nlighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than ever I \\nsaw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life. \\nMany a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure : and had \\nI gotten it into the water I make no question but I should have \\nbegun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be per- \\nformed, that ever was undertaken. \\n\\nBut all my devices to get it into the water failed me. It \\nlay about one hundred yards from the water ; but the first in- \\nconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek. To take \\naway this discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface \\nof the earth, and so make a declivity : this I began : but when \\n\\n\\n\\n108 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nthis was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was \\nstill much the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than I \\ncould the other boat. Then I measured the distance of \\nground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water \\nup to the canoe. Well, I began this work ; and when I began \\nto calculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the \\nstuff was to be thrown out, I found that, by the number of \\nhands I had, being none but my own, it must have been ten \\nor twelve years before I could have gone through with it ; for \\nthe shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have been \\nat least twenty feet deep ; so, with great reluctancy, I gave \\nthis attempt over also. \\n\\nI had now been here so lono; that manv things which I \\nbrought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very \\nmuch wasted, and near spent. \\n\\nMy ink had been gone some time, all but a very little, which \\nI eked out with water, till it was so pale, it scarce left any ap- \\npearance of black upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made \\nuse of it to minute down the days of the month on which any \\nremarkable thing happened to me : and, first, by casting up \\ntimes past, I remembered that there was a strange concurrence \\nof days in the various providences which befell me, and which, \\nif I had been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal \\nor fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked upon with \\na great deal of curiosity. \\n\\nFirst, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away \\nfrom my father and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to \\ngo to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the Salleo \\nman-of-war, and made a slave ; the same day of the year that \\nI escaped out of the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Eoads, \\nthat same day-year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee \\nin a boat ; the same day of the year I was born on, viz., the \\n30th of September, that same day I had my life so miraculously \\nsaved twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this \\nisland ; so that my wicked life and my solitary life began both \\non a day. \\n\\nThe next thing to my ink being wasted, was the biscuit \\nwhich I brought out of the ship ; this I had husbanded to the \\nlast degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for \\nabove a year; and yet I was quite without bread for near a \\nyear before I got any corn of my own. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 \\n\\nMy clothes, too, began to decay ; as to linen, I had had none \\na good while, except some chequered shirts which I found in \\nthe chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved ; \\nbecause many times I could bear no other clothes on but a \\nshirt. \\n\\nUpon these views, I began to consider about putting the \\nfew rags I had into some order ; I had worn out all the waist- \\ncoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not \\nmake jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, \\nand with such other materials as I had ; so I set to work, \\ntailoring, or rather, indeed, botching, for I made most piteous \\nwork of it. However, I made shift to make two or three new \\nwaistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great while ; as \\nfor breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed \\ntill afterwards. \\n\\nI have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures \\nthat I killed, I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung- \\nup stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some \\nof them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but \\nothers were very useful. The first thing I made of these was \\na great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside, to shoot \\noff the rain ; and this I performed so well, that after, I made \\nme a suit of clothes wholly of these skins. \\n\\nAfter this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make \\nan umbrella ; I was in great want of one ; I had seen them \\nmade in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the great \\nheats there, and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and \\ngreater too, being nearer the equinox ; besides, as I was \\nobliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, \\nas well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains with \\nit, and was a great while before I could make anything likely \\nto hold : nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two \\nor three before I made one to my mind : but at last I made \\none that answered indifferently well ; the main difficulty I \\nfound was to make it let down. I could make it spread, but \\nif it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for \\nme any way but just over my head. However, at last, I made \\none to answer, and covered it with skins, the hair upwards, \\nso that it cast oft* the rain like a pent-house, and kept off the \\nsun so eilectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of tho \\nweather with greater advantage than I could before in the \\n\\n\\n\\n110 ROBINSOX CRUSO\". \\n\\ncoolest, and when I had no need of it, could close it, and \\ncarry it under my arm. \\n\\nI cannot say, that after this, for five years, any extraordinary \\nthing happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in \\nthe same place as before ; the chief things I was employed in, \\nbesides my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and \\ncuring my raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough \\nto have sufficient stock of one year\\'s provision beforehand ; and \\nmy daily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one labour, \\nto make a canoe, which at last I finished : so that, by digging \\na canal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it \\ninto the creek, almost half amile. As for the first, which was \\nso vastly big, I was obligectvsto let it lie where h was, as a \\nmemorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time ; indeed, \\nthe next time, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and \\nwas in a place where I could not get the water to it at any less \\ndistance than near half a mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable \\nat last, I never gave it over ; and though I was near two years \\nabout it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes of having a \\nboat to go off to sea at last. \\n\\nHowever, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size \\nof it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in \\nview when I made the first ; of venturing over to the terra \\nJirma, where it was above forty miles broad ; accordingly the \\nsmallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and \\nnow I thought no more of it. My next design was to make a \\ncruise round the island ; for as I had been on the other side in \\none place, crossing over the land, so the discoveries I made in \\nthat little journey made mo very eager to see other parts of the \\ncoast ; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing \\nround the island. \\n\\nFor this purpose, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and \\nmade a sail too out of some of the pieces of the ship\\'s sails \\nwhich lay in store. Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried \\nthe boat, I found she would sail very well : then I made little \\nlockers, at each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, \\nammunition, &c\\\\, into, to be kept dry, and a little, long, hollow \\nplace I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, \\nmaking a flap to hang down over it, to keep it dry. \\n\\nI fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, to stand over \\nmy head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning; \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. Ill \\n\\nand thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the \\nsea : but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. At \\nlast, being eager to view the circumference of my little king- \\ndom, I resolved upon my cruise ; and accordingly I victualled \\nmy ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves of \\nbarley bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little bottle \\nof rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and \\ntwo large watch coats I had saved out of the seamen\\'s chests ; \\nthese I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in \\nthe night. \\n\\nIt was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, \\nor captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, \\nand I found it much longer than I expected ; for though the \\nisland itself was not very large, yet when I came to the east \\nside of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two \\nleagues into the sea, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying \\ndry half a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way \\nout to sea to double the point. \\n\\nWhen first I discovered them, I was going to give over my \\nenterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far it might \\noblige mo to go out to sea ; and, above all, doubting how I \\nshould get back again : so I came to an anchor ; for I had made \\na kind of an anchor, with a piece of a broken grappling which \\nI got out of the ship. \\n\\nBut the third day, in the morning, I ventured : but I am a \\nwarning to all rash and ignorant pilots ; for no sooner was I \\ncome to the point, when I was not even my boat\\'s length from \\nthe shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water, and a \\ncurrent like the sluice of a mill: it carried my boat along with \\nit with such violence that all I could do could not keep her so \\nmuch as on the edge of it ; but I found it hurried me farther \\nand farther out from the eddy, which was on my left hand. \\nThere was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with \\nmy paddles signified nothing ; and now I began to give myself \\nover for lost ; for as the current was on both sides of the island, \\nI knew in a few leagues\\' distance they must join again, and \\nthen I was irrecoverably gone ; so that I had no prospect before \\nme but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough, \\nbut of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise \\non the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it \\ninto the I]<>r;t ; and I had a great jar of fresh water; but what \\n\\n\\n\\n112 KOBIXSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nwas all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be \\nsure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand \\nleagues at least. \\n\\nAnd now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God \\nto make even the most miserable condition of mankind worse. \\nNow I looked back upon my desolate, solitary island, as the \\nmost pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness my \\nheart could wish for was to be but there again. It is scarcely \\npossible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven \\nfrom my beloved island into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, \\nand in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again. How- \\never, I worked hard till my strength was almost exhausted, \\nand kept my boat as much to the northward, that is towards \\nthe side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I \\ncould ; when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I \\nthought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing up \\nfrom S.S.E. This cheered my heart a little, and especially \\nwhen, in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. \\nBy this time I had got at a frightful distance from the island, \\nand had the least cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had \\nbeen undone another way, too ; for I had no compass on board, \\nand should never have known how to have steered towards the \\nisland, if I had but once lost sight of it ; but the weather con- \\ntinuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and \\nspread my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, \\nto get out of the current. \\n\\nJust as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to \\nstretch away, I saw by the clearness of the water some alter- \\nation of the current was near ; and presently I found to the \\ncast, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks : \\nthese rocks caused the current to part again, and as the main \\nstress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the. \\nnorth-cast, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks,\\' \\nand made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north- \\nwest, with a very sharp stream. \\n\\nThey who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to \\nthem upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going \\nto murder them, or who have been in such extremities, may \\nguess what my present surprise of jov was, and how gladly I \\nput my boat into tlie stream of this eddy; and the wind also \\nfreshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running cheer- \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CKUSOE. 113 \\n\\nfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under \\nfoot. \\n\\nThis eddy carried me about, a league in my way back again, \\ndirectly towards the island, but about two leagues more to the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPACE 146. \\n\\n\\n\\nnorthward than the current winch carried me away at first; so \\nthat when I came near the island, I found mvsolf open to the \\nnorthern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the island, \\nopposite to that which I went out from. \\n\\nWhen I had made something more than a league of way bv \\nMio help of this eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no \\no \\n\\n\\n\\nHi- ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nfarther. However, being between two great currents in the \\nwake of the island, I found the water at least still, and running \\nno way ; and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept \\non steering directly for the island, and in about an hour came \\nwithin about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water, \\nJ soon got to land. \\n\\nWhen I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God \\nthanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts \\nof my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such \\nthings as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a \\nlittle cove that I had spied under some trees, and laid me down \\nto sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the \\nvoyage. \\n\\nI was now at a great loss which way to get home with my \\nboat ; I had run so much hazard, and knew too much of the \\ncase, to think of attempting it by the way I went out ; so I \\nresolved on the next morning to make my way westward along \\nthe shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay \\nup my frigate in safety, so as to have her again, if I wanted her. \\nIn about three miles, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about \\na mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet \\nor brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my \\nboat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock \\nmade on purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed \\nmy boat very safe, I went on shore to look about me, and see \\nwhere I was. \\n\\nI soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I \\nhad been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore ; so \\ntaking nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella, for \\nit was exceedingly hot, I began my march. The way was \\ncomfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, \\nand I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found \\neverything standing as I had left it. \\n\\nI got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest \\nmy limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep ; but judge \\nyou, if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be \\nin, when I was awaked out of my sleep by a voice, calling me \\nby my name several times, \"Hoi, in, Robin, Eobin Crusoe; \\npoor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where \\nare you ? Where have you been ?\\' 1 was so dead asleep at first, \\nbeing fatigued with rowing the first part of the dav, and with \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CEUSOE. 115 \\n\\nwalking the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly; but \\ndozing between sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that \\nsomebody spoke to me ; but as the voice continued to repeat \\n\" Robin Crusoe, Eobin Crusoe,\" at last I began to wake more \\nperfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started \\nup in the utmost consternation ; but no sooner were my eye3 \\nopen, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge ; and \\nimmediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just \\nin such bemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and \\nteach him : and he had learned it so perfectly that he would \\nsit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, \\n\"Poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where have you \\nbeen? How came you here?\" and such things as I had taught \\nhim. \\n\\nHowever, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that \\nindeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I \\ncould compose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature \\ngot thither ; and then, how he should just keep about the \\nplace, and nowhere else ; but as I was well satisfied it could \\nbo nobody but honest Poll, I got over it ; and holding out my \\nhand, and calling him by his name, \"Poll,\" the sociable crea- \\nture came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, \\nand continued talking to me, \"Poor Robin Crusoe! and how \\ndid I come here ? and where had I been V just as if he had \\nbeen overjoyed to see me again ; and so I carried him home \\nalong with me. \\n\\nI had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and \\nhad enough to do for many days, to sit still, and reflect upon \\nthe danger I had been in. I would have been very glad to \\nhave had my boat again on my side of the island ; butl knew \\nnot how it was practicable to get it about. I contented myself \\nto be without any boat, though it had been the product of so \\nmany months\\' labour to make it, and of so many more to get it \\ninto the sea. \\n\\nIn tins government of my temper, I remained near a year; \\nand lived a vow sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose ; \\nand my thoughts being very much composed as to my condition, \\nand fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of \\nProvidence, I thought I lived really very happily in ail tilings, \\nexcept that of society. \\n\\n1 unproved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises \\n\\n\\n\\n116 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n■which my necessities put mo upon applying myself to ; and I \\nbelieve I should, upon occasion, have made a very good car- \\npenter, especially considering how few tools I had. \\n\\nBesides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my \\nearthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with a \\nwheel, which I found infinitely easier and better ; because I \\nmade things round and shaped, which before were filthy thing* \\nindeed to look on. But I think I was never more vain of my \\nown performance, or more joyful for anything I found out, than \\nfor my being able to made a tobacco-pipe ; and though it was \\na very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burned \\nred, like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and \\nwould draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, \\nfor I had been always used to smoke ; and there were pipes in \\nthe ship, but I forgot them at first, not thinking that there was \\ntobacco in the island ; and afterwards, when I searched the- \\nship again, I could not come at any pipes. \\n\\nIn my wiekerware, also, I improved much, and made abun- \\ndance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed \\nmie\\'; though not very handsome, yet they were such as were- \\nTory handy and convenient for laying things up in, er fetching \\nthings home. Also, large deep baskets were the receivers of \\nmy corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and \\ncured, and kept it in great baskets. \\n\\nI began now to perceive that my powder abated considerably: \\nthis was a want which it was impossible for me to supplv, and \\nI began seriously to consider what I must do when I should \\nhave no more powder ; that is to say, how I should kill any \\ngoats. I had, in the third year of my being here, kept a \\nyoung kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in hopes of getting \\na he-goat: but I could not by any means bring it to pass, till \\nmy kid grew an old goat ; and as I could never find in my \\nheart to kill her, she died at Lost of mere age. \\n\\nBut being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and my \\nammunition growing low, I sot myself to studv some art to \\ntrap and snare the goats, to see whether I couhfnot catch some- \\nof them alive ; and particularly, I wanted a she-goat great \\nwith young. For this purpose, I made snares to hamper them; \\nbut my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I always \\nfound them broken, and my bait devoured. At length, I re- \\nsolved to try a pitfall: s\\\\> i dug several large pits in the earth, \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 117 \\n\\nin plaees where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over \\nthose pits I placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a \\ngreat weight upon them ; and several times I put ears of barley \\nand dry rice, without setting the trap ; and I could easily per- \\nceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for I \\ncould see the marks of their feet. At length, I set three traps \\nin one night, and going the next morning, I found them all \\nstanding, and yet the bait eaten and gone: this was very dis- \\ncouraging. However, I altered my traps : and, not to trouble \\nyou with particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I \\nfound in one of them a large old he-goat ; and in one of the \\nothers, three kids, a male and two females. \\n\\nAs to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; ho was \\nso fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him, to bring him \\naway alive, which was what I wanted ° so I even let him out, \\nand he ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits. \\nBut I did not then know what I afterwards learned, that \\nhunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay there three or \\nfour clays without food, and then have carried him some water \\nto drink, and then a little corn, he would have been as tame as \\none of the kids ; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable crea- \\ntures, where they are well used. \\n\\nHowever, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at \\nthat time: then I went to the three kids, and, taking them one \\nby one, I tied them with strings together, and with somo \\ndiinculty brought them all home. \\n\\nIt was a good while before they would feed ; but throwing \\nthem some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be \\ntame. And now I found that if I expected to supply myself \\nwith goats\\' flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding \\nsome up tame was my only way, when, perhaps, 1 might have \\nthem about my house like a flock of sheep. But, then, it \\noccurred to me that I must keep the tamo from the wild, or \\nelse they would ahvays^un wild when they grew up; and the \\nonly way for this was to have somo enclosed piece of ground, \\n-well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so effect- \\nually, that those within might not break out, or those without \\nbreak in. \\n\\nThis was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet, as I \\nsaw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was \\nto find out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely to \\n\\n\\n\\n118 eobisson ci;u.s.)i:. \\n\\nbe herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover \\nto keep them from the sun. \\n\\nThose who understand such enclosures will think I had very \\nlittle contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for \\nall these, which had two or three little drills of fresh water in \\nit, and at one end was very woody, — they will smile at my \\nforecast, when I shall tell them I began by enclosing this piece \\nof ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale must have \\nbeen at least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so \\ngreat as to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like \\nto have time enough to do it in ; but I did not consider that \\nmy goats would be as wild in so much compass as if they had \\nhad the whole island, and I should have so much room to chase \\nthem in that I should never catch them. \\n\\nMy hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty \\nyards when this thought occurred to me ; so I presently stopped \\nshort, and, for the beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of \\nabout one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred \\nyards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as many as I \\nshould have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock increased, \\nI could add more ground to my enclosure. \\n\\nThis was acting with some prudence, and I went to work \\nwith courage. I was about three months hedging in the first \\npiece; and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the \\nbest part of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible, \\nto make them familiar ; and very often I would go and carry \\nthem some ears of barley and corn, or a handful of rice, and \\nfeed them out of my hand ; so that, after my enclosure was \\nfinished, and I let them loose, they would follow me up and \\ndown, bleating after me for a handful of corn. \\n\\nThis answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had \\na flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years \\nmore I had thrce-and-forty, besides several that I took and \\nkilled for my food. After that, I enaJpsed five -everal pieces \\nof ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, \\nto take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of \\nground into another. \\n\\nBut this was not all ; for now I not only had goats\\' flesh to \\nfeed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thin-- which, indeed, \\nin the beginning, I did not so much as thin!; of. and which, \\nwhen it came into my thoughts, was really an a.reeable sur- \\n\\n\\n\\nK03INS0N CKU30E. 119 \\n\\nprise, for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon \\nor two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies \\nof food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make \\nuse of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, \\nor seen butter or cheese made only when I was a boy, after a \\ngreat many essays and miscarriages, made both butter and \\ncheese at last, also salt (though I found it partly made to my \\nhand by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the \\nsea), and never wanted it afterwards. \\n\\nIt would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my \\nlittle family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the \\nprince and lord of the whole island ; I had the lives of all my \\nsubjects at my absolute command ; I could hang, draw, give \\nliberty, and take it away, and no rebels among my subjects. \\nThen, to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone, attended \\nby my servants! Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the \\nonly person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now \\ngrown very old and crazy, and had found no species to mul- \\ntiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand, and two cats, \\none on one side of the table, and one on the other, expecting \\nnow and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of my special \\nfavour. \\n\\nBut these were not the two cats which I brought on shore \\nat first, for they were both of them dead, and had been in- \\nterred near my habitation by my own hand ; but one of them \\nhaving multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these \\nwere two which I had preserved tame. With this attendance \\nand in this plentiful manner I lived ; neither could I be said to \\nwant anything but society. \\n\\nI was something impatient to have the use of my bo at, \\nthough very loath to run any more hazards ; and therefore \\nsometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, \\nand at other times I sat myself down contented enough with- \\nout her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go \\ndown to the point of the island, where, in my last ramble, I \\nwent up the hill to see how the shore lay ; this inclination in- \\ncreased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel \\nthither by land, following the edge of the shore. I did so ; \\nbut had anyone in England met such a man as I was, it must \\neither have fiightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter ; \\nand as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not \\n\\n\\n\\n120 eocinson cnusoi:. \\n\\nbut smile at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshin \\nwith such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased t> \\ntake a sketch of my figure as follows : — \\n\\nI had, a high shapeless cap, made of a goat\\'s skin, with a flaj: \\nhanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as tc \\nshoot the rain off from running into my neck, nothing being sc \\nhui^ful in these climates as the rain upon the- flesh under the \\nclothes. \\n\\nI had a short jacket of goat\\'s skin, the skirts coming down \\nto about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed \\nbreeches of the same ; the breeches were made of the skin oi \\nan old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either \\nside, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my| \\nlegs ; stockings and shoes I had none, but had made mo a pair \\nof somethings, I scarce know what to call them, like buskins, \\nto flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes, \\nbut of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of \\nmy clothes. \\n\\nI had on a broad belt of goat\\'s skin dried, which I drew \\ntogether with two thongs of the same instead of buckles, and \\nin a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a sword \\nand dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side, \\nand one on the other. I had another belt not so broad, and \\nfastened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder, \\nand at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, \\nboth made of goat\\'s skin too, in one of which hung my powder, \\nin the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and \\non my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy, \\nugly, goat\\'s skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most \\nnecessary thing I had about me next to my gun. As for my \\nface, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like as one might \\nexpect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within \\nnine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once \\nsuffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long ; \\nbut as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it \\npretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had \\ntrimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had \\nseen worn by some Turks at Sallce, for the Moors did net \\nwear such, though the Turks did ; of these moustachios, or \\nwhiskers, I will not say they were long enough to hang my \\nhat upon them, but they were of a length and shape mon- \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CKUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n121 \\n\\n\\n\\nstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed for \\nfrightful. \\n\\nBut all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few \\nto observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence, so I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nl\\'AQE 156. \\n\\n\\n\\nsay no more of that. In this kind of dress I went my new \\njourney, and was out five or six days. I travelled first along \\nthe sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought my \\nboat to an anchor to get upon the rocks ; and having no boat \\nnow to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way to the \\nsame height that I was upon before, when, looking forward to \\n\\n\\n\\n124 \\n\\n\\n\\nKOBINSOlf CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nhensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the \\ncurrents or winds, or any other accident. But now I come to \\na new scene of my life. \\n\\nIt happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I \\nwas exceedingly surprised with the print of a man\\'s naked foot \\non the shore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand. I \\nstood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. \\nI listened, I looked round me, but I could hear nothing nor \\nsee anything ; I went up to a rising ground, to look farther; \\nI went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was all one: \\nI could see no other impression but that one. I went to it \\nagain to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might \\nnot be my fancy ; but there was no room for that, for there \\nwas exactly the print of a foot — toes, heel, and every part of \\na foot. How it came thither I knew not, nor could I in the \\nleast imagine ; but after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like \\na man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came to my for- \\ntification, not feeling, as Ave say, the ground I went on, but \\nterrified to the last degree, looking behind me at every two \\nor three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying \\nevery stump at a distance to be a man. \\n\\nWhen I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever \\nafter this), I fled into it like one pursued. \\n\\nI slept none that night ; the farther I was from the occasion \\nof my fright, the greater my apprehensions were. Sometimes \\nI fancied it must be the devil, and reason joined in with me in \\nthis supposition, for how should any other thing in human \\nshape come into the place ? Where was the vessel that brought \\nthem ? What marks were there of any other footstep ? And \\nhow was it possible a man should come there ? I considered \\nthat the devil might have found out abundance of other ways \\nto have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot ; that \\nas I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never \\nhave been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was \\nten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and \\nin the sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high \\nwind, would have defaced entirely. All this seemed incon- \\nsistent with the thing itself, and with all the notions we usually \\nentertain of the subtilty ot the devil. \\n\\nWhile these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very \\nthankful in my thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be \\n\\n\\n\\nKOEIXSOX CKUSOE. 125\\' \\n\\nthereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by \\nwhich they would have concluded that some inhabitants had \\nbeen in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me. \\nThen terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their \\nhaving found out my boat, and that there were people herej \\nand that, if so, I should certainly have them come again in \\ngreater numbers, and devour me ; that if it should happen that \\nthey should not find me, yet they would find my enclosure, \\ndestroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame \\ngoats, and I should perish at last for mere want. \\n\\nThus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former \\nconfidence in God, which was founded upon such wonderful \\nexperience as I had had of His goodness ; as if He that had \\nfed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by His power, \\nthe provision which He had made for me by His goodness. I \\nreproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any \\nmore corn one year than would just serve me till the next \\nseason, as if no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoy- \\ning the crop that was upon the ground ; and this I thought so- \\njust a reproof, that I l-esolved for the future to have two or \\nthree years\\' corn beforehand ; so that, whatever might come, I \\nmight not perish for want of bread. \\n\\nOne morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts, \\nabout my danger from the appearances of savages, I found it \\ndiscomposed me very much ; upon which these words of the \\nScripture came into my thoughts \" Call upon me in the day \\nof trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.\" \\nUpon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not \\nonly comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray \\nearnestly to God for deliverance : when I had done praying, \\nI took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words \\nthat presented to me were, \" Wait on the Lord, and be of good \\ncheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart ; wait, I say, on the \\nLord.\" It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me. \\nIn answer, I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more \\nsad, at least on that occasion. \\n\\nIn the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and re- \\nflection?, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this might \\nbe a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the \\nprint of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat; \\nthis cheered me up a little, too, and I began to persuade my- \\n\\n\\n\\n126 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nSelf it was all a delusion ; that it was nothing else but my own \\nfoot ; and why might I not come that way from the boat, as \\nwell as I was going that way to the boat ? Again I considered \\nalso, that I could by no means tell, for certain, where I had \\ntrod, and where I had not ; and that if, at last, this was only \\nthe print of my own foot, I had played the part of those fools \\nwho try to make stories of spectres and apparitions, and then \\nare frightened at them more than anybody. \\n\\nNow I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for \\nI had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, \\nso that I began to starve for provisions ; for I had little or \\nnothing within doors but some barley-cakes and water : then \\nI knew that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually \\nwas my evening diversion ; and the poor creatures were in great \\npain and inconvenience for want of it ; and, indeed, it almost \\nspoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk. En- \\ncouraging myself, therefore, with the belief that this Avas \\nnothing but the print of one of my own feet, and that I might \\nbe truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to go abroad \\nagain, and went to my country-house to milk my flock : but \\nto see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked \\nbehind me, how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down \\nmy basket and run for my life, it would have made anyone \\nhave thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that \\nI had been lately most terribly frightened ; and so, indeed, I \\nhad. However, I went down thus two or three days, and \\nhaving seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think \\nthere was really nothing in it but my own imagination ; but I \\ncould not persuade myself fully of this till I should go down \\nto the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it \\nby my own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that \\nI might be assured it was my own foot : but when I came to \\nthe place — first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid \\nup my boat, I could not possibly be on shore anywhere there- \\nabouts : secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my \\nown foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both \\nthese things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave \\nme the vapours again to the highest degree, so that I shook \\nwith cold like one in an ague ; and I went home again, filled \\nwith the belief that some man or men, had been on shore there; \\nor, in short, that the island was inhabited, and I might be \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 12/ \\n\\nsurprised before I was aware ; and what course to take for my \\nsecurity I knew not. \\n\\nThe first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my \\nenclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, \\nlest the enemy should find thera, and then frequent the island \\nin prospect of the same or the like booty : then the simple \\nthing of digging up my two corn fields, lest they should find \\nsuch a grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the island: \\nthen to demolish my bower and tent, that they might not see \\nany vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in \\norder to find out the persons inhabiting. \\n\\nThese were the subjects of the first night\\'s cogitations after \\nI was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so \\noverrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full \\nof vapours. \\n\\nThis confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night ; but \\nin the morning I fell asleep ; and having, by the amusement of \\nmy mind, been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I \\nslept very soundly, and waked much better composed than I \\nhad ever been before. And now T began to think sedately; \\nand, upon debate with myself, I concluded that this island \\n(which was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther \\nfrom the main land than as I had seen) was not so entirely \\nabandoned as I might imagine ; that although there were no \\nstated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that there might \\nsometimes come boats off from the shore, who, either with \\ndesign, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross \\nwinds, might come to this place ; that I had lived here fifteen \\nyears now, and had not met with the least shadow or figure of \\nany people yet ; and that, if at any time they should be driven \\nhere, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever \\nthey could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon any \\noccasion ; that the most I could suggest any danger from was, \\nfrom any casual accidental landing of straggling people from \\nthe main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were \\nhere against their wills, so they made no stay here, but went \\noff again with all possible speed; seldom staying one night on \\nshore, lest they should not have the help of the tides and day- \\nlight back again ; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but \\nto consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages \\nland upon the spot. \\n\\n\\n\\n128 \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nNow I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so \\nlarge as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, \\ncame out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock : \\nupon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw \\nme a second fortification, in the same manner of a semicircle, \\nat a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double \\nrow of trees about twelve years before, of which I made \\nmention: these trees having been planted so thick before, they \\nwanted but few pile3 to be driven between them, that they \\nmight be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon \\nfinished. So that I now had a double wall ; and my outer \\nwall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and every- \\nthing I could think of, to make it strong ; having in it seven \\nlittle holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the \\ninside of this, I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, with \\ncontinually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the \\nfoot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven \\nholes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice \\nthat I had got seven on shore out of the ship ; these I planted \\nlike my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held them like \\na carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes\\' \\ntime; this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and \\nyet never thought myself safe till it was done. \\n\\nWhen this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, \\nfor a great length every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the \\nosier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could \\nwell stand ; insomuch, that I believe I might set in near twenty \\nthonsand of them, leaving a pretty large space between them \\nand my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they \\nmight have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted \\nto approach my outer wall. \\n\\nThus, in two years\\' time, I had a thick grove; and in five \\nor six years\\' time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing \\nso monstrously thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly \\nimpassable : and no men, of what kind soever, could ever \\nimagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a habita- \\ntion. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and \\nout (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to \\napart of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left \\nroom to place another ladder upon that; so when the two \\nladders were taken down, no man living could come down to \\n\\n\\n\\nROBrXSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n129 \\n\\n\\n\\njae without doing himself mischief; and if they had come downs \\nthoy were still on the outside of my outer wall. \\n\\nThus I took all the measures human prudence could sugget, \\nfor ray own preservation ; and it will he seen, at length, that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVage 153 \\n\\nthey were not altogether without just reason ; though I foresaw \\nnothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to \\nme. \\n\\nWhile this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my \\nother affairs ; for I had a great concern upon me for my little \\nherd of goats : they were not only a ready supply to me on \\n9 \\n\\n\\n\\n130 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nevery occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, ■without the \\nexpense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of \\nhunting after the -wild ones ; and I was loath to lose the ad- \\nvantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again. \\n\\nFor this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of \\nbut two ways to preserve them ; one was, to find another con- \\nvenient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them \\ninto it every night ; and the other was to inclose two or three \\nlittle bits of land, remote from one another, and as much con- \\ncealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen young \\ngoats in each place ; so that if any disaster happened to the \\nflock in general, I might be able to raise them again with little \\ntrouble and time : and this, though it would require a good \\ndeal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational \\ndesign. \\n\\nAccordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired \\nparts of the island ; and I pitched upon one, which was as \\nj>rivate, indeed, as my heart could wish lor : it was a little damp \\npiece of ground, in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, \\nwhere I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come \\nback that way from the eastern part of the island. Here I \\nfound a clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded \\nwith woods, that it was almost an inclosure by nature ; at least, \\nit did not want near so much labour to make it so, as the other \\npiece of ground I had worked so hard at. \\n\\nI immediately went to work with this piece of ground ; and, \\nin less than a month\\'s time, I had so fenced it round that my \\nflock were well enough secured in it ; so, without any further \\ndelay, I removed ten young she-goats, and two he-goats, to \\nthis piece ; and, when they were there, I continued to perfect \\nthe fence, till I had made it as secure as the other ; which, \\nhowever, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time \\nby a great deal. All this labour I was at the expense of, \\npurely from my apprehensions on the account of the print of a \\nman\\'s foot ; for, as yet, I had never seen any human creature \\ncome near the island ; and I had now lived two years under \\nthis uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable \\nthan it was before, as may be well imagined by any who \\nknow what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of. \\nman. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUGOE. 131 \\n\\nAfter I had thus secured one part of my little living stocks \\nI went about the -whole island, searching for another private \\nplace to make such another deposit ; when, wandering more \\nto the v.-est point of the island than I had ever done yet, and \\nlooking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a \\ngreat distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one \\nof the seamen\\'s chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I had \\nit not about me ; and this was so remote that I could not tell \\nwhat to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not \\nable to hold to look any longer ; whether it was a boat or nor, \\nI do not know, but as T descended from the hill I could see no \\nmore of it, so I gave it over ; only I resolved to go no more \\nout without a perspective glass in my pocket. Yv hen I was \\ncome down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I \\nhad never been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing \\nthe print of a man\\'s foot was not such a strange tiling in the \\nisland as I imagined : but that it was a special providence \\nthat I was cast upon the side of the island where the savages \\nnever came, I should easily have known that nothing was more \\nfrequent than for the canoes from the main, when they hap- \\npened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side \\nof the island for harbour : likewise, as they often mot and \\nfought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, \\nwould bring them over to this shore, where, according to their \\ndreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat \\nthem. \\n\\nWhen I was come down the hill to the shore, I was perfectly \\nconfounded and amazed ; nor is it possible for me to express \\nthe horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread with skulls, \\nhands, feet, and other bones of human bodies ; and particu- \\nlarly, I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and \\na circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the \\nsavage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon \\nthe bodies of their fellow-creatures. \\n\\nI was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I \\nentertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a \\nlong while ; all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts \\nof such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror \\nof the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard \\nof it often, yet I never had so near a view of before ; in \\n\\n\\n\\nloZ ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nshort, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle, and \\nwith all the speed\" I could, walked on towards my own \\nhabitation. \\n\\nWhen I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood \\nstill awhile, as amazed, and then recovering myself, I looked \\nup with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of \\ntears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot \\nin a part of the world where I was distinguished from such \\ndreadful creatures as these ; and that, though I had esteemed \\nmy present condition very miserable, had yet given me so many \\ncomforts in it that I had still more to give thanks for than to \\ncomplain of. \\n\\nIn this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and \\nbegan to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circum- \\nstances, than ever I was before : for I observed that these \\nwretches never came to this island in search of what they could \\nget ; perhaps not seeking, wanting, or expecting, anything \\nhere; and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered, \\n■woody part of it, without finding anything to their purpose. \\nI knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never \\nsaw the least footsteps of human creature there before ; and I \\nmight be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I was \\nnow, if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no \\nmanner of occasion to do ; it being my only business to keep \\nmyself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better \\nsort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. \\nYet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches \\nthat I have been speaking of, and of the wretched, inhuman \\ncustom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I \\ncontinued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle, \\nfor almost two years after this. I did not so much as go to \\nlook after my boat all this time, but began rather to think of \\nmaking another ; for I could not think of ever making \\nany more attempts to bring the other boat round the island to \\nme, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at sea. \\n\\nTime, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no \\ndanger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off \\nmy uneasiness about them ; and I began to live just in the same \\ncomposed manner as before, only with this difference, that I \\nused more caution, and kept my eyes more about me, lest I should \\nhappen to be seen by any of them ; and particularly, I was \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 \\n\\nmore cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on the \\nisland, should happen to hear it. It was, therefore, a very good \\nprovidence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed \\nof goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the \\n■woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch any of them after \\nthis, it was by snares and traps, as I had done before : so that \\nfor two years after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off, \\nthough I never went out without it ; and, what was more, as \\nI had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them \\nout with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat- \\nskin belt. I also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I \\nhad out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also ; so \\nthat I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went \\nabroad, if you add to the former description of myself, the par- \\nticular of two pistols, and a great broad-sword hanging at my \\nside in a belt, but without a scabbard. \\n\\nAs in my present condition there were not really many \\nthings which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights \\nI had been in about these savage wretches, and the concern I \\nhad been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of \\nmy invention for my own conveniences ; and I had dropped a \\ngood design, which I had once bent my thoughts too much \\nupon, and that was to try if I could not make some of my barley \\ninto malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. This was \\nreally a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the \\nsimplicity of it: for I presently saw there would be the want \\nof several things necessary to the making my beer, that it \\nwould be impossible for me to supply ; as, first, casks to pre- \\nserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, \\nI could never compass : no, though I spent not only many days, \\nbut weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. \\nIn the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to \\nmake it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil ; and yet \\n1 with all these things wanting, I verily believe, had not the \\nfrights and terrors I was in about the savages intervened, I had \\nundertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass, too ; for I seldom \\ngave anything over without accomplishing it, when once I had \\nit in my head to begin it. Eut my invention now ran quite \\nanother way ; for, night and day, 1 could think of nothing but \\nhow I might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel, \\nbloody entertainment j and ? if possible, gave the victim they \\n\\n\\n\\n131 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nshould bring hither to destroy. But what could one man do \\namong them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of \\nthem together, with their darts, or their bows and arrows, \\nwith which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with \\nmy gun ? \\n\\nWhile my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and \\na bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I \\nmay call it, the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of \\nthe barbarous wretches devouring one another, abetted my \\nmalice. Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill, \\nwhere I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of \\ntheir boats coming ; and might then, even before they would \\nbe ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into some \\nthickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large \\nenough to conceal me entirely ; and there I might sit and ob- \\nserve all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their \\nheads, when they were so close together as that it would be \\nnext to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that I could \\nfail wounding three or four of them at the first shot. In this \\nplace then, I resolved to fulOl my design ; and accordingly, I \\nprepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The \\ntwo muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or \\nfive smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets ; and the \\nfowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the \\nlargest size; I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets \\neach ; and, in this posture, well provided with ammunition for \\na second and third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition. \\n\\nAfter I had thus laid the scheme of my design, I made my tour \\nevery morning to the top of the hill, to see if I could observe \\nany boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing \\nover towards it ; but I began to tire of this hard duty, after I \\nhad for two or three months constantly kept my watch, but \\ncame always back without any discovery ; there having not, in \\nall that time, been the least appearance, not only ©n or near \\nthe shore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my eye* or glass \\ncould reach every way. \\n\\nAs long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so \\nlong also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits \\nseemed to be all the while in a suitable form for so outrageous \\nan execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for \\nau offence which I had not at all entered into any discussion \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 \\n\\nof in my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first \\nfired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural customs of the \\npeople of that country. But now, when I began to bo weary \\nof the fruitless excursion which I had made so long and so far \\nevery morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself began \\nto alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to \\nconsider what I was going to engage in ; what authority or \\ncall I had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these \\nmen as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many \\nages, to suffer to go on unpunished, and to be, as it were, the \\nexecutioners of His judgments one upon another; how far these \\npeople were offenders against me, and what right I had to en- \\ngage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously \\nupon one another. \\n\\nWhen I considered this a. little, it followed necessarily that \\nI was certainly in the wrong ; that these people were not mur- \\nderers in the sense that I had before condemned them in my \\nthoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers who \\noften put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more fre- \\nquently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to the \\nsword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their \\narms and submitted. \\n\\nThese considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind \\nof a full stop ; and I began, by little and little, to be off my \\ndesign, and to conclude I had taken wrong measures in my \\nresolution to attack the savages ; and that it was not my \\nbusiness to meddle with them, unless they first attacked me ; \\nand this it was my business, if possible, to prevent : but that, if \\nI were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my duty. \\n\\nIn this disposition I continued for near a year after this; \\nand so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon \\nthese wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the \\nhill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know \\nwhether any of them had been on shore or not, that I might \\nnot be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, \\nor be provoked by any advantage that might present itself, to \\nfall upon them: only this I did; I went and removed my boat» \\nwhich I had on the other side of the island, and carried it down \\nto the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little \\ncove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, \\nby reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would \\n\\n\\n\\n136 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nnot, come with their boats on any account whatever. With \\nmy boat I carried away everything that I had left there be- \\nlonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, \\nviz., a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like \\nan anchor, but which indeed could not be called either anchor \\nor grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its kind; \\nall these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow \\nfor discovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human \\nhabitation upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself more \\nretired than ever, and seldom went from my cell except upon \\nmy constant employment, to milk my she-goats, and manage \\nmy little flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the other \\npart of the island, was out of danger. \\n\\nI believe the reader of this will not think it strange, if I con- \\nfess, that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, \\nand the concern that was now upon me, put an end to all in- \\nvention, and to all the contrivances that I had laid for my \\nfuture accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of \\nmy safety more now upon my hands than that of r.iy food. I \\ncared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear \\nthe noise I might make should be heard : much less would I \\nfire a gun for the same reason : and, above all, I was intoler- \\nably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible \\nat a great distance in the day, should betray me. For this \\nreason, I removed that part of my business which required fire, \\nsuch as burning of pots and pipes, &c, into my new apartment \\nin the woods; where, after I had been some time, I found to \\nmy unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, \\nwhich went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, \\nhad he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to \\nventure in. \\n\\nThe mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great \\nrock, where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see \\nabundant reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence), \\nI was cutting down some thick branches of trees to make \\ncharcoal ; and before I go on I must observe the reason of \\nmy making this charcoal, which was thus : I was afraid of \\nmaking a smoke about my habitation, as I said before : and \\nyet I could not live there without baking my bread, cooking \\nmy meat, &c, so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I \\nhad seen done in England, under turf, till it became chark or \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n137 \\n\\n\\n\\ndry coal : and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal \\nto carry home, and perform the other services for which fire \\nwas wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is by the \\nbye. While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 160. \\n\\nthat, behind a very thick branch of low brushwood or under- \\nwood, there was a kind of hollow place : I was curious to look \\nin it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found \\nit was sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps \\nanother with me ; but I must confess to you that I made more \\nhaste out than I did in, when, looking farther into the place, \\n\\n\\n\\n138 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nand which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes \\nof some creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which \\ntwinkled like two stars ; the dim light from the cave\\'s mouth \\nshining directly in, and making the reflection. However, \\nafter some pause, I recovered myself, and began to call myself \\na thousand fools, and to think that he that was afraid to see \\nthe devil, was not fit to live twenty years in an island all \\nalone ; and that I might well think there was nothing in this \\ncave that was more frightful than myself. Upon this, plucking \\nup my courage, I took tip a firebrand, and in I rushed again, \\nwith the stick flaming in ray hand : I had not gone three steps \\nin, before I was almost as much frightened as before ; for I \\nheard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and \\nit was followed by a broken noise, as of words half expressed, \\nand then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed \\nstruck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat, \\nand if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for if \\nthat my hair might not have lifted it off. But still plucking \\nup my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a \\nlittle with considering that the power and presence of God \\nwas everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward \\nagain, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little \\nover my head, I saw lying on the ground a monstrous, \\nfrightful, old he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and \\ngasping for life, and dying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred \\nhim a little to see if I eould get him out, and he essayed to \\nget up, but was not able to raise himself ; and I thought with \\nmyself he might even lie there, — for if he had frightened me, \\nso he would certainly fright any of the savages, if any one of \\nthem should be so hardy as to come in there while he had \\nany life in him. \\n\\nI was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look \\nround me, when I found the cave was but very small, — it \\nmight be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, \\nneither round nor square, no hands having ever been em- \\nployed in making it but those of mere Nature. I observed \\nalso that there was a place at the farther side of it that went \\nin further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon \\nmy hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I know \\nnot ; so, having no candle, I gave it over for that time, but \\nresolved to come again the next day provided with candles \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBIXSOX CEUoOE. 139 \\n\\nand a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of one of the \\nmuskets, with some wildfire in the pan. \\n\\nAccordingly, the next day I came provided with six large \\ncandles of my own making (for I made very good candles now \\nof goats\\' tallow, but was hard set for candle-wick, using \\nsometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of \\na weed like nettles) ; and going into this low place I was \\nobliged to creep upon all-fours, almost ten yards, — which, by \\nthe way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering \\nthat I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. \\nWhen I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose \\nhigher up, I believe near twenty feet ; but never was such a \\nglorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was to look \\nround the sides and roof of this vault or cave — the wall re- \\nflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles. \\nWhat it was in the rock, — whether diamonds or any other \\nprecious stones, or gold, — which I rather supposed it to be,— \\nI knew not. The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, \\nor grotto, though perfectly dark ; the floor was dry and level, \\nand had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that there \\nwas no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither \\nwas there any damp or wet on the sides or roof; the only \\ndifficulty in it was the entrance, — which, however, as it was \\na place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought \\nwas a convenience, — so that I was really rejoiced at the dis- \\ncovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of \\nthose things which I was most anxious about to this place ; \\nparticularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, \\nand all my spare arms, viz., tw r o fowling-pieces — for I had \\nthree in all — and three muskets — for of them I had eight in \\nall; so I kept in my castle only five, which stood ready \\nmounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, and were \\nready also to take out upon any expedition. Upon this \\noccasion of removing my ammunition I happened to open the \\nbarrel of powder Avhich I took up out of the sea, and which \\nhad been wet, and I found that the water had penetrated \\nabout three or four inches into the powder on every side. \\nwhich caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside \\nlike a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds ot \\nvery good powder in the centre of the cask. This was a very \\nagreeable discovery to mo at that time ; so I carried all awaj \\n\\n\\n\\n140 .ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nthither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder \\nwith me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind ; I \\nalso carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets. \\n\\nI fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who \\nwere said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none \\ncould come at them ; for I persuaded myself, while I was \\nhere, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they \\ncould never find me out — or if they did, they would not \\nventure to attack me here. The old goat whom I found \\nexpiring died in the mouth of the cave the next day after I \\nmade this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a \\ngreat hole there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, \\nthan to drag him out ; so I interred him there. \\n\\nI was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this \\nisland, and was so naturalized to the place and the manner \\nof living, that, could I but have enjoyed the certainty that \\nno savages would come to the place to disturb me, I could \\nhave been content to have capitulated for spending the rest \\nof my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me \\ndown and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also \\narrived to some little diversions and amusement?, which \\nmade the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than \\nit did before; — first, I had taught my Poll, as I named be- \\nfore, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so \\narticulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me, for I \\nbelieve no bird ever spoke plainer, — and he lived with me no \\nless than six-and-twenty years; how long he might have \\nlived afterwards I know not, though I know they have a \\nnotion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My dog \\nwas a pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than \\nsixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age. As \\nfor my cats, they multiplied to that degree, that I was obliged \\nto shoot several of them at first, to keep them from devour- \\ning me and all I had; but, at length, when the two old ones \\nI brought with me were gone, and after some time continually \\ndriving them from me, and letting them have no provision \\nwith me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two or \\nthree favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when \\nthey had any, I always drowned ; and these were part of my \\nfamily. Besides these, I also kept two or three household \\nkids about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand ; and I \\n\\n\\n\\nKOBIXSOX CRUSOE. 141 \\n\\nhad two more parrots, which talked pretty well, and would \\nall call <: Kobinson Crusoe,\" but none like my first; nor, in- \\ndeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had done \\nwith him. I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose names I \\nknew not, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; \\nand the little stakes which I had planted before my castle- \\nwall being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls \\nall lived among these low trees, and bred there, which was \\nvery agreeable to me, — so that I began to be very well con- \\ntented with the life I led, if I could have been secured from \\nthe dread of the savages. But it was otherwise directed. \\n\\nIt was now the month of December, in my twenty-third \\nyear ; and this being the southern solstice (for winter I can- \\nnot call it), was the particular time of my harvest, and \\nrequired me to be pretty much abroad in the fields, when, \\ngoing out early in the morning, even before it was thorough \\ndaylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire \\nupon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles, \\ntowards that part of the island where I had observed some \\nsavages had been, as before, and not on the other, side; but, \\nto my great affliction, it was on my side of the island. \\n\\nI was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped \\nshort within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be \\nsurprised; and yet I had no more peace within, from the \\napprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over \\nthe island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my \\nworks and improvements, they would immediately conclude \\nthat there were people in the place, and would then never \\nrest till they had found me out. In this extremity I went \\nback directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, \\nand made all things without look as wild and natural as I \\ncould. \\n\\nThen I prepared myself within, putting myself in a pos- \\nture of defence ; I loaded all my muskets, which Avere mounted \\nupon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to \\ndefend myself to the last gasp, — not forgetting seriously to \\ncommend myself to the divine protection, and earnestly to \\npray to God to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. \\nI continued in this posture about two hours, and began to be \\nimpatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send \\nout. After sitting awhile longer, and musing what I should \\n\\n\\n\\n142 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ndo in this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any \\nlonger; so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where \\nthere was a fiat place, and then pulling the ladder after me, I \\nset it up again, and mounted the top of the hill, and pulling \\nout my perspective-glass, which I had taken on purpose, I \\nlaid me down fiat on my belly on the ground, and began to \\nlook for the place. I presently found there were no less than \\nnine naked savages, sitting round a small, fire they had made, \\nnot to warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather \\nbeing extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of \\ntheir barbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought \\nwith them. \\n\\nThey had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up \\nupon the shore ; and it was then ebb of tide, they seemed to \\nme to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It \\nis not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into, \\nespecially seeing them come on my side of the island, and so \\nnear to me; but when I considered their coming must be \\nalways with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be \\nmore sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go \\nabroad with safety all the time of the flood of tide, if they \\nwere not on shore before ; and having made this observation, \\nI went abroad about my harvest work with the more com- \\nposure. \\n\\nAs I expected, so it proved ; for, as soon as the tide made \\nto the westward, I saw them all take boat and row away. I \\nshould have observed, that for an hour or more before they \\nwent off they were dancing, and I could easily discern their \\npostures and gestures by my glass. \\n\\nAs soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns \\nupon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my \\ngreat sword by my side without a scabbard, and with all the \\nspeed I was able to make went away to the hill where I had \\ndiscovered the first appearance of all ; and as soon as I got \\nthither, I perceived there had been three canoes more of the \\nsavages at that place ; and looking out farther, I saw they \\nwere all at sea together, making over for the main. This \\nwas a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going down to the \\nshore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work \\nthey had been about had left behind it, I was so filled with \\nindignation at the sight, that I now began to premeditate the \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 143 \\n\\ndestruction of the next that I saw there, let them be whom. \\nor how many soever. It seemed evident to me that the visits \\nwhich they made thus to this island were not very frequent, \\nfor it was above fifteen months before any more of them came \\non shore there again — that is to say, I neither saw them nor \\nany footsteps or signals of them in all that time; yet all this \\nwhile I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant; appre- \\nhensions of their coming upon me by surprise. \\n\\nDuring all this time I was in the murdering humour, and \\nspent most of my hours, which should have been better em- \\nployed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them \\nthe very next time I should see them — especially if they \\nshould be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties ; \\nnor did I consider at all that if I killed one party — suppose \\nten or a dozen — I was still the next day or week, or month, \\nto kill another, and so another, even ad infinitum,, till I should \\nbe, at length, no less a murderer than they were in being \\nman-eaters — and perhaps much more so. I spent my days \\nnow in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that \\nI should one day or other fall into the hands ot these merci- \\nless creatures ; and if I did at any time venture abroad, it \\nwas not without looking round me with the greatest care and \\ncaution imaginable. And now I found, to my great comfort, \\nhow happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd \\nof goats ; for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, \\nespecially near that side of the island where they usually \\ncame, lest I should alarm the savages : and if they had fled \\nfrom me now, I was sure to have them come again with \\nperhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days, \\nand then I knew what to expect. However, I wore out a \\nrear and three months more before I ever saw any more of \\nthe savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon \\nobserve. It is true they might have been there once or \\ntwice ; but either they made no stay, or at least I did not \\nsee them ; but in the month of May, as near as I could cal- \\nculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange \\nencounter with them ;_ of which in its place. \\n\\nIt was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, \\nas well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon — for I \\nmarked all upon the post still — that it blew a very great \\nstorm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and \\n\\n\\n\\n144 \\n\\n\\n\\nKOJ3INSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nthunder, and a very foul night it was after it. I knew not \\nwhat was the particular occasion of it ; but as I was reading \\nin the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about \\nmy present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, \\nas I thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise \\nquite of a different nature from any I had met with before ; \\nfor the notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another \\nkind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable ; and, in \\na trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, \\nand pulled it after me ; and mounting it the second time, got \\nto the top of a hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid \\nme listen for a second gun, which, accordingly, in about half- \\na-minute, I heard ; and by the sound, knew that it was from \\nthat part of the sea wheue I was driven down the current in \\nmy boat. 1 immediately considered that this must be some \\nship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some \\nother ship in company, and fired these for signals of distress, \\nand to obtain help. I had the presence of mind, at that \\nminute^ to think, that though I could not help them, it might \\nbe they might help me ; so I brought together all the dry \\nwood I could get at hand, and, making a good pile, I set it \\non fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; \\nand, though the wind blew very hard, yet it burned fairly \\nout, so that I was certain, if there was any such thing as a \\nship, they must needs see it, and no doubt they did ; for as \\nsoon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, and \\nafter that several others, all from the same quarter. I plied \\nmy fire all night long, till daybreak : and when it was broad \\nday, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great dis- \\ntance at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I \\ncould not distinguish — no, not with my glass ; the distance \\nwas so great, and the weather still something hazy also ; at \\nleast, it was so out at sea. \\n\\nI looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived \\nthat it did not move ; so I presently concluded that it was a \\nship at anchor; and being, eager, you may be sure, to be \\nsatisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the \\nsouth side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly \\nbeen carried away by the current ; and getting up there, the \\nweather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly \\nsee, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the \\n\\n\\n\\nKOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n145 \\n\\n\\n\\nnight upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was \\nout in my boat. Had they seen the island, as I must neccs- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTAOE If?, \\n\\n\\n\\nsarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have \\nendeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help \\nof their boat ; but their firing off guns for help, especially \\n\\n\\n\\n146 \\n\\n\\n\\nKU131JNSUN (JliUSUK. \\n\\n\\n\\nwhen they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many \\nthoughts. First, I imagined that upon seeing my light, they \\nmight have put themselves into their boat, and endeavoured \\nto make the shore ; but that the sea running very high, they \\nmight ha\\\\;e been cast away. Other times, I imagined that \\nthey might have lost their boat before, as might be the case \\nmany ways ; particularly by the brealdng of the sea upon their \\nship, which many times obliged men to stave, or take in \\npieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with \\ntheir own hands. Other times, I imagined they had some \\nother ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of dis- \\ntress they made, had taken them ixp, and carried them off. \\nOther times, I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their \\nboat, and being hurried away by the current that I had been \\nformerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where \\nthere was nothing but misery and perishing : and that, per- \\nhaps, they might by this time think of starving, and of being \\nin a condition to eat one another. \\n\\nThere are some secret moving springs in the affections, \\nwhich, when they are set a-going by some object in view, or, \\nthough not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by the \\npower of imagination, that motion carries out the soul, by its \\nimpetuosity, to such violent eager embracings of the object \\nthat the absence of it is insupportable. Such were these \\nearnest wishings that but one man had been saved. I be- \\nlieve I repeated the words, \" O that it had been but one !\" \\na thousand times; and my desires were so moved by it, that \\nwhen I spoke the words my hands would clinch together, and \\nmy fingers would press the palms of my hands, so that if I \\nhad had any soft thing in my hand, I would have crushed it \\ninvoluntarily ; and the teeth in my head would strike to- \\ngether 3 and set against one another so strong, that for some \\ntime I could not part them again. But it was not to be ; \\neither their fate or mine, or both, forbade it, for till the \\nlast year of my being on this island, I never knew whether \\nany were saved out of that ship or no ; and had only the \\naffliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy \\ncome on shore at the end of the island which was next the \\nshipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seaman\\'s waistcoat, \\na pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; \\nbut nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 147 \\n\\nwas of. He had nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of- \\neight and a tobacco-pipe — the last was to me of ten times \\nmore value than the first. \\n\\nIt was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in \\nmy boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find some- \\nthing on board that might be useful to me. But that did \\nnot altogether press me so much, as the possibility that there \\nmight be yet some living creature on board, whose life I \\nmight not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort \\nmy own to the last degree ; and this thought clung so to my \\nheart that I could not be quiet night nor day, but I must \\nventure out in my boat on board this wreck ; and committing \\nthe rest to God\\'s providence, I thought the impression was so \\nstrong upon my mind that it could not be resisted, that it \\nmust come from some invisible direction, and that I should. \\nbe wanting to myself if I did not go. \\n\\nUnder the power of this impression, I hastened back to \\nmy castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity \\nof bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, \\na bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), and \\na basket of raisins; and thus, loading myself with everything \\nnecessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her, \\ngot her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went \\nhome again for more. My second cargo was a great bag of \\nxice, the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another \\nlarge pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of small loaves, \\nor barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat\\'s \\nmilk, and a cheese : all which, with great labour and sweat, \\nI carried to my boat ; and praying to God to direct my \\nvoyage, I put out, and rowing\\' the canoe along the shore, \\ncame at last to the utmost point of the island on the north- \\neast side, and hauled my boat into a little creek on the \\nshore. \\n\\n^ I resolved, the next morning, to set out with the first of the \\ntide; and, reposing myself for the night in my canoe, under \\nthe great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out, and having \\na strong steerage with my paddle, I went, at a great rate, \\ndirectly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up \\nto it.^ It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which, by its \\nbuilding, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two \\nrocks , all the stern and quarter of her v.\\'ere\\'beaten to pieces \\n\\n\\n\\n148 EOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nby the sea ; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, \\nhad run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast \\nwere broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the \\nhead and bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a \\ndog appeared upon her, who seeing me coming, yelped and \\ncried ; and, as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to \\ncome to me : I took him into the boat, but found him almost \\ndead with hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, \\nand he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving \\na fortnight in the snow : I then gave the poor creature spme \\nfresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he would \\nhave burst himself. After this I went on board; but the first \\nsight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or \\nforecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one another. \\n[ concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, \\nit being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so continually \\nDver her, that the men were not able to bear it, and were \\nstrangled with the constant rushing in of the water, as much \\nis if they had been under water. Besides the dog, there was \\nnothing left in the ship that had life ; nor any goods, that I \\n:ould see, but what were spoiled by the water. There were \\nsome casks of liquer, whether wine or brandy I knew not, \\nwhich lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed \\n3ut, I could see ; but they were too big to meddle with. I \\nsaw several chests, which I believe belonged to some of the \\nseamen ; and I got two of them into the boat, without ex- \\nimining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship been \\nfixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might \\nhave made a good voyage ; for, by what I found in these two- \\nchests, I had reason to suppose the ship had a great deal of \\nwealth on board ; and, if I may guess from the course she \\nsteered, she must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or \\nthe Eio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the \\nBrazils to the Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so \\nperhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in \\nher, but of no use, at that time, to anybody ; but what became \\nof the crew I then knew not. \\n\\nI found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of \\nibout twenty gallons, which I got into my\\' boat with much \\ndifficulty. There were several muskets in the cabin, and a \\ngreat powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it: \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 \\n\\nas for the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, \\nbut took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, \\nwhich I wanted extremely ; as also two little brass kettles, a \\ncopper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron ; and with this \\ncargo, and the, dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make \\nhome again : and the same evening, about an hour within \\nnight, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the \\nlast degree. I reposed that night in the boat ; and in the \\nmorning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new \\n•cave, and not carry it home to my castle. After refreshing \\nmyself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began to examine \\nthe particulars. The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of \\nrum, but not such as we had at the Brazils ; and, in a word, \\nnot at all good ; but when I came to open the chests, I found \\nseveral things of great use to me : for example, I found in \\none a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled \\nwith cordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held \\nabout three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found \\ntwo pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened \\nalso on the top that the salt water had not hurt them ; and \\ntwo more ot the same, which the water had spoiled. I found \\nsome very good shirts, which were very welcome to me ; and \\n•about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs, and \\n•coloured neckcloths ; the former were also very welcome, \\nbeing exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. \\nBesides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found \\nthere three great bags of pieces-of-eight, which held about \\neleven hundred pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapped \\nup in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars of \\ngold ; I suppose they might all weigh near a pound. In the \\nother chest were some clothes, but of little value; but, by \\nthe circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner\\'s \\nmate; though there was no powder in it except two pounds \\nof fine glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, \\nfor charging their fowling pieces on occasion. Upon the \\n■whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of any use to \\nme ; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it ; \\nit was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would have \\ngiven it all for three or four pair of English shoes and \\nstockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had none \\non my feet for many years. I had, indeed, got two pair of \\n\\n\\n\\n150 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nshoes now, which I took off the feet of the two drowned men \\nwhom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more in one \\nof the chests, which were very welcome to me ; but they were \\nnot like our English shoes, either for ease or service, being \\nrather what we call pumps than shoes. I found in this \\nseaman\\'s chest about fifty pieces-of-eight, in rials, but no- \\ngold : I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other r \\nwhich seemed to belong to some officer. Well, however, I \\nlugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had \\ndone that before which I had brought from our own ship ; \\nbut it was a great pity, as I said, that the other part of this \\nship had not come to my share ; for I am satisfied I might \\nhave loaded my canoe several times over with money ; and, \\nthought I, if I ever escape to England, it might lie here safe \\nenough till I come again and fetch it. \\n\\nHaving now brought all my things on shore, and secured \\nthem, I went back to my boat, and rowed her along the shore \\nto her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best \\nof my way to my old habitation, where I found everything \\nsafe and quiet. I began now to repose myself, live after my \\nold fashion, and take care of my family affairs ; and for a \\nwhile I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than \\nI used to be, looked out often er, and did not go abroad so \\nmuch ; and if, at any time, I did stir with any freedom, it was \\nalways to the east part of the island, where I was pretty well \\nsatisfied the savages never came, and where I could go without \\nso many precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition \\nas I always carried with me if I went the other way. I lived \\nin this condition near two years more ; but my unlucky head,. \\nthat was always to let me know it was born to make my body \\nmiserable, was all these two years filled with projects and \\ndesigns, how, if it were possible, I might get away from this \\nisland ; for, sometimes I was for making another voyage to \\nthe wreck, though my reason told me that there was nothing \\nleft there worth the hazard of my voyage ; sometimes, for a \\nramble one way, sometimes another : and I believe verily, if \\nI had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have \\nventured to sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither. \\n\\n1 am now supposed to be retired into my castle, after my \\nlate voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured \\nunder water, as usual, and my condition restored to what it, \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 151 \\n\\nwas before: I had more wealth, indeed, than what I had \\nbefore, but was not at all the richer ; for I had no more use \\nfor it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards \\ncame there. \\n\\nIt was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the \\nfour-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island \\nof solitude, I was lying in my hammock, awake, very well in \\nhealth, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor \\nany uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but could by no \\nmeans close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep ; no, not a wink \\nall night long, otherwise than as follows : — It is impossible to \\nset down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled \\nthrough that great thoroughfare of the brain — the memory, \\nin this night\\'s time : I ran over the whole history of my life \\nin miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming \\nto this island, and also of that part of my life since I came to \\nthis island. In my reflections upon the state of my case \\nsince I came on shore on this island, I was comparing the \\nhappy posture of my affairs in the first years of my habita- \\ntion here, with the life of anxiety, fear, and care, which I had \\nlived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand; \\nnot that I did not believe the savages had frequented the \\nisland even all the while, and might have been several hun- \\ndreds of them at times on shore there ; but I had never \\nknown it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about it ; \\nmy satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the same, \\nand I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if I had \\nnever really been exposed to it. \\n\\nI looked upon my present condition as the most miserable \\nthat could possibly be ; that I was not able to throw myself \\ninto anything but death, that could be called worse ; and if I \\nreached the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with \\nrelief, or I might coast along, as I did on the African shore, \\ntill I came to some inhabited country, and where I might find \\nsome relief; and, after all, perhaps I might fall in with some \\nChristian ship that might take me in ; and if the worst came \\nto the worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all \\nthese miseries at once. \\n\\nWhen this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or \\nmore, with such violence that it set my very blood into a fer- \\nment, and my pulse beat as if I had been in a fever, merely \\n\\n\\n\\n152 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nwith the extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, nature, \\nas if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the very \\nthoughts of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One would \\nhave thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor \\nof anything relating to it : but I dreamed that as I was going \\nout in the morning as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the \\nshore two canoes and eleven savages, coming to land, and that \\nthey brought with them another savage, whom they were \\ngoing to kill, in order to eat him ; when, on a sudden, the \\nsavage that they were going to kill, jumped away, and ran \\nfor his life ; and I thought, in my sleep, that he came running \\ninto my little thick grove before my fortification, to hide \\nhimself; and that I, seeing him alone, and not perceiving \\nthat the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, \\nand smiling upon him, encouraged him : that he kneeled \\ndown to me, seeming to pray me to assist him ; upon which \\nI showed him my ladder, made him go up, and carried him \\ninto my cave, and he \"became my servant : and that as soon \\nas I had got this man, I said to myself, \" Now I may certainly \\nventure to the main land, for this fellow will serve me as a \\npilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for pro- \\nvisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured ; \\nwhat places to venture into, and what to shun.\" I waked \\nwith this thought ; and was under such inexpressible impres- \\nsions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that \\nthe disappointments which I felt upon coming to myself, and \\nfinding that it was no more than a dream, were equally ex- \\ntravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great de- \\njection of spirits. \\n\\nUpon this, however, I made this conclusion — that my only \\nway to go about to attempt an escape was, if possible, to get \\na savage into my possession ; and, if possible, it should be \\none of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to > be \\neaten, and should bring hither to kill. But these thoughts \\nstill were attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible \\nto effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and \\nkilling them all; and this was not only a very desperate \\nattempt, and might miscarry ; but, on the other hand, I had \\ngreatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself; and my heart \\ntrembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though \\nit was for my deliverance. The eager prevailing desire of \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n153 \\n\\n\\n\\ndeliverance at length mastered all the rest ; and I resolved, \\nif possible, to get one of these savages into my hands, cost \\nwhat it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do it, \\nand this indeed was very difficult to resolve on; but as I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPAGC 183. \\n\\ncould pitch upon no probable mean3 for it, so I resolved to \\nput myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on \\nshore, and leave the rest to the event ; taking such measures \\nas the opportunity should present, let what would be. \\n\\nWith these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon \\nthe scout as often as possible, and indeed so often, that I was \\n\\n\\n\\n154 EOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nheartily tired of it ; for it was above a year and a half that \\nI waited ; and for great part of that time went out to the \\nwest end, and to the south-west corner of the island almost \\nevery day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This was \\nvery discouraging, and began to trouble me much ; but the \\nlonger it seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was for it : \\nin a word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these \\nsavages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was now eager \\nto be upon them. Besides, I fancied myself able to manage \\none, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make \\nthem entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct \\nthem, and to prevent their being able at any time to do me \\nany hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself with \\nthis affair ; but nothing still presented itself; all my fancies \\nand schemes came to nothing, for no savages came near me \\nfor a great while. \\n\\nAbout a year and a half after I entertained these notions, \\nI was surprised one morning by seeing no less than five \\ncanoes all on shore together on my side the island, and the \\npeople who belonged to them all landed and out of my sight. \\nThe number of them broke all my measures ; for seeing so \\nmany, and knowing that they always came four or six, or \\nsometimes more in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, \\nor how to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty men \\nsingle-handed ; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and dis- \\ncomforted. However, I put myself into the same position for \\nan attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready \\nfor action, if anything had presented. Having waited a good \\nwhile, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, \\nbeing very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, \\nand clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, \\nas usual ; standing so, however, that my head did not appear \\nabove the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any \\nmeans. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective \\nglass, that they were no less than thirty in number ; that they \\nhad a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How \\nthey had cooked it I knew not, or what it was ; but they were \\nall dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and \\nfigures, their own way, round the fire. \\n\\nWhile I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my \\nperspective, two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 155- \\n\\nwhere, it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought \\nout for the slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately \\nfall ; being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden \\nsword, for that was their way ; and two or three others were \\nat work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery,. \\nwhile the other victim was left standing by himself, till they \\nshould be ready for him. In that very moment, this poor \\nwretch, seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound, Nature \\ninspired him with hopes of life, and he started away from \\nthem, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, \\ndirectly towards me ; I mean towards that part of the coast \\nwhere my habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I \\nmust acknowledge, when I perceived him run my way ; and \\nespecially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the \\nwhole body ; and now I expected that part of my dream was \\ncoming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in \\nmy grove : but I could not depend, by any means, upon my \\ndream, that the other savages would not pursue him thither, \\nand find him there. However, I kept my station, and my \\nspirits began to recover when I found that there was not \\nabove three men that followed him ; and still more was I \\nencouraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceed- \\ningly in running, and gained ground on them ; so that, if he \\ncould but hold out for half an hour, I saw easily he would \\nfairly get away from them all. \\n\\nThere was between them and my castle, the creek, which \\nI mentioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed \\nmy cargoes out of the ship ; and this I saw plainly he must \\nnecessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken \\nthere ; but when the savage escaping came thither, he made \\nnothing of it, though the tide was then up; but, plunging in, \\nswam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, \\nand ran with exceeding strength and swiftness. When the \\nthroe persons came to the creek, I found that two of them \\ncould swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on \\nthe other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther, \\nand soon after went softly back again ; which, as it happened, \\nwas very well for him in the end. I observed that the two \\nwho swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over \\nthe creek as the fellow was that fled from them. It°came \\nvery warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that \\n\\n\\n\\n156 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nnow was the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a com- \\npanion or assistant ; and that I was plainly called by Provi- \\ndence to save this poor creature\\'s life. I immediately ran \\ndown the ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two \\nguns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders, as I ob- \\nserved before, and getting up again with the same haste to \\nthe top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea ; and having a \\nvery short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the way \\nbetween the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to \\nhim that fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much \\nfrightened at me as at them ; but I beckoned with my hand \\nto him to come back ; and, in the meantime, I slowly ad- \\nvanced towards the two that followed ; then rushing at once \\nupon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my \\npiece. I was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest \\nhear ; though, at that distance, it would not have been easily \\nheard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would \\nnot have known what to make of it. Having knocked this \\nfellow down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he \\nhad been frightened, and I advanced towards him : but as I \\ncame nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, \\nand was fitting it to shoot at me : so I was then obliged to \\nshoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first \\nshot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he \\nsaw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was \\nso frightened with the fire and noise of my piece, that he \\nrtood stock still, and neither came forward, nor went back- \\nward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to \\ncome on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come \\nforward, which he easily understood, and came a little way ; \\nthen stopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped \\nagain ; and I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as \\nif he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, \\nas his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come \\nto me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I \\ncould think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling \\ndown every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment \\nfor saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, \\nand beckoned to him to come still nearer : at length, he came \\nclose to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the \\nground, and laid his head upon the ground, and, taking me \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSOX CRUSOE. 157 \\n\\nby the foot, set my foot upon his head ; this, it seems, was in \\ntoken of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, \\nand made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But \\nthere was more work to do yet ; for I perceived the savage \\nwhom I had knocked down was not killed, but stunned with \\nthe blow, and began to come to himself : so I pointed to him, \\nand showed him the savage, that he was not dead ; upon this \\nhe spoke some words to me, and though I could not under- \\nstand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear ; for \\nthey were the first sound of a man\\'s voice that I had heard, \\nmy own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there \\nwas no time for such reflections now ; the savage who was \\nknocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the \\nground, and I perceived that my savage began to be afraid ; \\nbut when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, \\nas if I would shoot him : upon this, my savage, for so I call \\nhim now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which \\nhung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no sooner \\nhad it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow, cut oiF his \\nhead so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done \\nit sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one \\nwho, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life \\nbefore, except their own wooden swords: however, it seems, \\nas I learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so \\nsharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even \\ncut off heads with them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow \\ntoo. When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in \\nsign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with \\nabundance of gestures which I did not understand, laid it \\ndown, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just \\nbefore me. But that which astonished him most, was to \\nknow how I killed the other Indian so far off; so pointing to \\nhim, he made signs to me to let him go to him ; and I bade \\nhim go, as well as I could. When he came to him, he stood \\nlike one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one \\nside, then on the other; looked at the wound the bullet had \\nmade, which it seems was just in his breast, where it had \\nmade a hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed ; \\nbut he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took \\nup his bow and arrows, and came back ; so I turned to go \\naway, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him \\n\\n\\n\\n158 EOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nthat more might come after them. Upon this, he made signs \\nto me that he should bury them with sand, that they might \\nnot be seen by the rest, if they followed ; and so I made signs \\nto him again to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant he \\nhad scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough to \\nbury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered \\nhim ; and did so by the other also ; I believe he had buried \\nthem both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, \\nJ carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, \\non the farther part of the island : so I did not let my dream \\n•come to pass in that part, that he came into my grove for \\nshelter. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to \\neat, and a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in \\ngreat distress for, from his running : and having refreshed \\nhim, I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, show- \\ning him a place where I had laid some rice-straw, and a \\nblanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes ; \\nso the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep. \\n\\nHe was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, \\nwith straight strong limbs, not too large, tall and well shaped ; \\nand, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a \\nvery good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but \\nseemed to have something very manly in his face ; and yet \\nhe had all the sweetness and softness of a European in his \\ncountenance too, especially when he smiled. His hair was \\nlong and black, not curled like wool; his forehead very high \\nand large ; and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in \\nhis eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite black, but \\nvery tawny : and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as \\nthe Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of America \\nare, but of a bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in it \\nsomething very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. \\nHis face was round and plump ; his nose small, not flat like \\nthe negroes ; a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth \\nwell set, and as white as ivory. \\n\\nAfter he had slumbered about half an hour, he awoke \\nagain, and came out of the cave to me ; for I had been milking \\nmy goats, which I had in the enclosure just by : when he \\n<espied me, he came running to me, laying himself down agaia \\nupon the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble, \\nthankful disposition, making a great many antic gestures to \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 159 \\n\\nshow it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground, close \\nto my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had \\ndone before ; and after this, made all the signs to me of sub- \\njection, servitude, and submission, imaginable, to let me know \\nhow he would serve me so long as he lived. I understood \\nhim in many things, and let him know I was very well pleased \\nwith him. In a little time, I began to speak to him, and \\nteach him to speak to me ; and, first, I let him know his name \\nshould be Friday, which was the day I saved his life : I \\ncalled him so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught \\nhim to say Master ; and then let him know that was to be my \\nname : I likewise taught him to say Yes or No, and to know \\nthe meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen \\npot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my \\noread in it ; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, \\nwhich he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was \\nvery good for him. I kept there with him all night ; but, as \\nsoon as it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and \\nlet him know I would give him some clothes ; at which he \\nseemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we went by \\nthe place where he had buried the two men, he pointed \\nexactly to the place, and showed me the marks that he had \\nmade to find them again, making signs to me that we should \\ndig them up again and eat them. At this, I appeared very \\nangry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would \\nvomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to \\nhim to come away, which he did immediately, with great sub- \\nmission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if \\nhis enemies were gone ; and, pulling out my glass, I looked, \\nand saw plainly the place where they had been, but no \\nappearance of them or their canoes; so that it was plain \\nthey were gone, and had left their two comrades behind \\nihem, without any search after them. \\n\\nBut I was not content with this discovery ; but having now \\nmore courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my \\nman Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with \\nthe bow and arrows at his back, which I found he could use \\nvery dexterously, making him carry one gun for me, and I \\ntwo for myself; and away we marched to the place where \\nthese creatures had been ; for I had a mind now to get some \\nfuller intelligence of them. When I came to the place, my \\n\\n\\n\\n160 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nvery blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk within \\nme, at the horror of the spectacle ; indeed, it was a dreadful \\nsight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing \\nof it. The place was covered with human bones, the ground \\ndyed with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left here and \\nthere, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all \\nthe tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making \\nthere, after a victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, \\nfive hands, and the bones of three or four legs and feet, and \\nabundance of other parts of the bodies ; and Friday, by his \\nsigns, made me understand that they brought over four \\nprisoners to feast upon ; that three of them were eaten up, \\nand that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth ; that there \\nhad been a great battle between them and their next king, \\nof whose subjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they \\nhad taken a great number of prisoners ; all of which were \\ncarried to several places, by those who had taken them in the \\nfight, in order to feast xipon them, as was done here by these \\nwretches upon those they brought hither. \\n\\nI caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and \\nwhatever remained, and lay them together in a heap, and \\nmake a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I \\nfound Friday had still a hankering stomach after some of the \\nflesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature ; but I showed so \\nmuch abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, that he durst \\nnot discover it : for I had, by some means, let him know that \\nI would kill him if he offered it. \\n\\nWhen he had done this, we came back to our castle ; and \\nthere I fell to work for my man Friday ; and first of all, I \\ngave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the \\npoor gunner\\'s chest I mentioned, which I found in the wreck, \\nand which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well ; and \\nthen I made him a jerkin of goat\\'s skin, as well as my skill \\nwould allow (for I was now grown a tolerably good tailor) ; \\nand I gave him a cap which I made of hare\\'s skin, very con- \\nvenient and fashionable enough : and thus he was clothed, \\nfor the present, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased \\nto see himself almost as well clothed as his master. It is \\ntrue, he went awkwardly in these clothes at first : wearing \\nthe drawers was very awkward to lrim, and the sleeves of the \\nwaistcoat galled his shoulders and the in-ide of his arms; \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CBUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n161 \\n\\n\\n\\nbut a little easing them where he complained they hurt \\nhim, and using himself to them, he took to them at length \\nvery well. \\n\\nThe next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbegan to consider where I should lodge him ; and, that I \\nmight do well for him and yet be perfectly easy myself, I \\nmade a little tent for him in the vacant place between my \\ntwo fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the outside \\nof the first. As there was a door or entrance there into my \\ncave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it of \\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 \\n\\n\\n\\n1G2 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nboards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the \\nentrance ; and, causing the door to open in the inside, I \\nbarred it up in the. night, taking in my ladders too ; so that \\nFriday could no way come at me in the inside of my inner- \\nmost wall, without making so much noise in getting over that \\nit must needs awaken me ; for my first wall had now a com- \\nplete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and \\nleaning up to the side of the hill, which was again laid across \\nwith smaller sticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over \\na great thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong, like \\nreeds, and at the hole which was left to go in or out by the \\nladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had \\nbeen attempted on the outside, would not have opened at all, \\nbut would have fallen down and made a great noise : as to \\nweapons, I took them all into my side every night. But \\nI Deeded none of all this precaution; for never man had a \\nmore faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me; \\nwithout passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and \\nengaged ; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a \\nchild to a father; and I cUire say he would have sacrificed \\nhis life to save mine, upon any occasion whatsoever : the \\nmany testimonies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt, \\nand soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions \\nfor my safety on this account. \\n\\nI was greatly delighted with him, and made it my business \\nto teach him everything that was proper to make him useful, \\nhandy, and helpful ; but especially to make him speak, and \\nunderstand me when I spoke : and he was the aptest scholar \\nthat ever was ; and particularly was so merry, so constantly \\ndiligent, and so pleased when he could but understand me, or \\nmake me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to \\ntalk to him. Now my life began to be so easy that I began \\nto say to myself, that could I but have been safe from more \\nsavages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the place \\nwhere I lived. \\n\\nAfter I had been two or three days returned to my castle, \\nI thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid \\nway of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal\\'s stomach, \\nI ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I took him out with \\nme one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to \\nkill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 163 \\n\\nIt ; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the \\nshade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of \\nFriday — \"Hold!\" said I, \"stand still;\" and made signs to \\nhim not to stir : immediately, I presented my piece, shot, and \\nkilled one of the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a \\ndistance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did \\nnot know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly \\nsurprised ; trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that \\nI thought he would have sunk down. He did not see the \\nkid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his \\nwaistcoat, to feel whether he was not wounded; and, as I \\nfound presently, thought I was resolved to kill him : for he \\ncame and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, \\nsaid a great many things I did not understand ; but I could \\neasily see the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him. \\n\\nI soon found a way to convince him that I would do him \\nno harm ; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, \\nand pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him \\nto run and fetch it, which he did : and while he was wonder- \\ning, and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded \\nmy gun again. By-and-by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, \\nsitting upon a tree within shot ; so, to let Friday understand \\na little what I would do, I called him to me again, pointed at \\nthe fowl, which was indeed a parrot., though I thought it had \\nbeen a hawk ; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, \\nand to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would \\nmake it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and \\nkill that bird ; accordingly, I fired, and bade him look, and \\nimmediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one \\nfrightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to him ; and \\nI found he was the more amazed, because he did not see me \\nput anything into the gun, but thought that there must be \\nsome wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing, \\nable to kill man, beast, bird, or anything near or far off; and \\nthe astonishment this created in him was such as could not \\nwear off for a long time ; and, I believe, if I would have let \\nhim, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the \\ngun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several days \\nafter ; but he would speak to it and talk to it, as if it had \\nanswered him, when he was by himself; which, as I after- \\nwards learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him. Well, \\n\\n\\n\\n164 ItOBINSON CKtJSOE. \\n\\nafter his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to \\nhim to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but! \\nstayed some time ; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had \\nfluttered away a good distance from the place where she fell : \\nhowever, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me ; \\nand as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I \\ntook this advantage to charge the gun again, and not to let \\nhim see me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark \\nthat might present ; but nothing more offered at that time : \\nso I brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the- \\nskin off, and cut it out as well as I could ; and having a pot \\nfit for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and \\nmade some very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, \\nI gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and \\nliked it very well ; but that which was strangest to him was \\nto see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the \\nsalt was not good to eat ; and putting a little into his own \\nmoiith, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter \\nat it, washing his mouth with fresh water after it : on the \\nother hand, I took some meat into my mouth without salt, \\nand I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as much \\nas he had done at the salt ; but it would not do ; he would \\nnever care for salt with his meat or in his broth, at least not \\nfor a great while, and then but a very little. \\n\\nHaving thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was \\nresolved to feast him the next day by roasting a piece of the \\nkid : this I did by hanging it before the fire on a string, as I \\nhad seen many people do in England, setting two poles up, \\none on each side of the fire, and one across on the top, and \\ntying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn con- \\ntinually. This Friday admired very much ; but when he \\ncame to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how \\nwell he liked it, that I could not but understand him : and at \\nlast he told me, as well as he could, he would never eat man\\'s- \\nflesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. \\n\\nThe next day, I set him to work to beating some corn out, \\nand sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed \\nbefore ; and he soon understood how to do it as well as I, \\nespecially after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and \\nthat it was to make bread of; for after that, I let him see me\\' \\nmake my bread, and bake it too ; and in a little time, Friday \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 165 \\n\\n■was able to do all the work for me as well as I could do it \\n■myself. \\n\\nI began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed \\ninstead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, \\nand plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do ; so I \\nmarked out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the \\nsame manner as before, in which Friday worked not only very \\n•willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully : and I \\ntold him what it was for — that it was for corn to make more \\nbread, because he was now with me, and that I might have \\nenough for him and myself too. He appeared very sensible \\nof that part, and let me know that he thought I had much \\nmore labour upon me on his account than I had for myself; \\nand that he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him \\nwhat to do. \\n\\nThis was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this \\nplace. Friday began to talk pretty Avell, and understand the \\nnames of almost everything I had occasion to call for, and of \\nevery place I had to send him to, and talked a great deal to \\nme ; so that, in short, I began now to have some use for my \\ntongue again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for \\nbefore. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a sin- \\ngular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned \\nhonesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I be- \\ngan really to love the creature ; and on his side, I believe he \\nloved me more than it was possible for him ever to love any- \\nthing before. \\n\\nI had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his \\nown country again ; and having taught him English so well \\nthat he could answer me almost any question, I asked him \\nwhether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in \\nbattle ? At which he smiled, and said, \" Yes, yes, we always \\nfight the better ;\" that is, he meant, always get the better in. \\nfight ; and so we began the following discourse : — \\n\\nMaster. — You always fight the better ; how come you t® \\nbe taken prisoner then, Friday ? \\n\\nFriday. — My nation beat much for all that. \\n\\nMaster. — How beat ? If your nation beat them, how came \\nyou to be taken ? \\n\\nFriday. — They more many than my nation, in the place \\n\\n\\n\\n166 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nwhere me was ; tliey take one, two three, and me : my nation \\nover-beat them in the yonder place, where me no was ; there \\nmy nation take one, two, great thousand. \\n\\nMaster. — But why did not your side recover you from the \\nhands of your enemies, then ? \\n\\nFriday. — They run, one, two, three, and me, and make go \\nin the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. \\n\\nMaster. — Well, Friday, and what does your nation do \\nwith the men they take ? Do they carry them away and eat \\nthem, as these did ? \\n\\nFriday. — Yes, my nation eat mans too : eat all up. \\n\\nMaster. — Where do they carry them? \\n\\nFriday. — Go to other place, where they think. \\n\\nMaster. — Do they come hither? \\n\\nFriday. — Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other else \\nplace. \\n\\nMaster. — Have you been here with them ? \\n\\nFriday. — Yes, I have been here (points to the N.W- side \\nof the island, which, it seems, was their side). \\n\\nBy this, I understood that my man Friday had formerly \\nbeen among the savages who used to come on shore on the \\nfarther part of the island, on the same man-eating occasions \\nhe was now brought for : and, some time after, when I took \\nthe courage to carry him to that side, being the same I \\nformerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told \\nme he was there once, when they eat up twenty men, two \\nwomen, and one child : he could not tell twenty in English, \\nbut he numbered them, by laying so many stones in a row, \\nand pointing to me to tell them over. \\n\\nI have told this passage, because it introduces what follows. \\nAfter this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it \\nwas from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes \\nwere not often lost. He told me there was no danger, no \\ncanoes ever lost ; but that after a little way out to sea, there \\nwas a current and wind, always one way in the morning, the \\nother in the afternoon. This I understood to be no more \\nthan the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I \\nafterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draft \\nand reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or \\ngulph of which river, as I found afterwards, our island lay ; \\n\\n\\n\\nKOBINSOK CRUSOE. 167 \\n\\nand that this land which I perceived to the W and N.W. \\nwas the great island of Trinidad, on the north point of the \\nmouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions \\nabout the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and \\nwhat nations were near : he told me all he knew, with the \\ngreatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the \\nseveral nations of his sort of people, but could get no other \\nname than Caribs: from whence I easily understood that \\nthese were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of \\nAmerica which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko \\nto Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told me, that up \\na great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting \\nof the moon, which must be west from their country, there \\ndwelt white-bearded men, like me, and pointed to my \\ngreat whiskers ; and that they had killed much mans, that \\nwas his word: by all which I understood he meant the \\nSpaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over \\nthe whole country, and were remembered by all the nations \\nfrom father to son. \\n\\nI inquired if he coitld tell me how I might go from this \\nisland and get among those white men: he told me, \"Yes, \\nyes, you may go in two canoe.\" I could not understand \\nwhat he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant \\nby two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he \\nmeant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This \\npart of Friday\\'s discourse I began to relish very well ; and \\nfrom this time I entertained some hopes that, one time or \\nother, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from \\nthis place, and that this poor savage might be a means to \\nhelp me. \\n\\nDuring the long time that Friday had now been with me, and \\nthat he began to speak to and understand me, I was wanting to \\nlay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind ; particu- \\nlarly I asked him one time, who made him. The poor creature \\ndid not understand me at all, but thought I had asked him \\nwho was his father : but I took it up by another handle, and \\nasked him, who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and \\nthe hills and woods. He told me, \" It was one Benamuckee, \\nthat lived beyond all;\" he could describe nothing of this \\ngreat person, but that he was very old, \" much older,\" he \\nsaid, \" than the sea or the land, the moon or the stars.\" I \\n\\n\\n\\n1G8 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nasked him then, if this old person had made all things, why \\ndid not all things worship him ? He looked very grave, and, \\nwith a perfect look of innocence, said, \" All things say to \\nhim.\" I asked him, if the people who die in his country \\nwent anywhere ? He said, \" Yes, they all went up to Bena- \\nmuckee.\" Then I asked him whether those they eat up went \\nthither too ? He said, \" Yes.\" \\n\\nFrpm these things, I began to instruct him in the know- \\nledge of the true God : I told him that the great Maker of \\nall things lived up there, pointing up towards heaven ; that \\nHe governed the world by the same power and providence \\nby which He made it ; that He was omnipotent, and could do \\neverything for us, give everything to us — take everything \\nfrom us ; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. \\n\\nI had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all \\nthe methods I took for this poor creature\\'s instruction, and \\nmust acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the same \\nprinciple will find, that in laying things open to him, I really \\ninformed and instructed myself in many things that either I \\ndid not knoAV, or had not fully considered before, but which \\noccurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for \\nthe information of this poor savage ; and I had more affection \\nin my inquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt \\nbefore : so that, whether this poor wild wretch was the better \\nfor me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever he \\ncame to me ; my grief sat lighter upon me ; my habitation \\ngrew comfortable to me beyond measure : and when I reflected \\nthat in this solitary life which I had been confined to, I had \\nnot only been moved to look up to heaven myself, and to seek \\nthe hand that had brought me here, but was now to be made \\nan instrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for \\naught I knew, the soul of a poor savage. \\n\\nI continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my \\ntime; and the conversation which employed the hours be- \\ntween Friday and me was such as made the three years which \\nwe lived there together perfectly and completely happy. \\n\\nAfter Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, \\nand that he could understand almost all I said to him, and \\nspeak pretty fluently, though in broken English, to me, I \\nacquainted him with my own history, or at least so much of \\nit as related to my coming to this place ; how I had lived \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n169 \\n\\n\\n\\nthere, and how long : I let him into the mystery, for such it \\n■was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to \\nshoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully de- \\nlighted with ; and I made him a belt, with a frog hanging to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTAGE 268. \\n\\n\\n\\nit ; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, \\nwhich was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but much \\nmore useful upon other occasions. \\n\\nI described to him the country of Europe, particularly \\nEngland, which I came from ; how we lived, how we wor- \\nshipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we \\n\\n\\n\\n170 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ntraded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an \\naccount of the wreck which I had been on board of, and \\nshowed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay : but \\nshe was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed him \\nthe ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and \\nwhich I could not stir with my whole strength then; but was \\nnow fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday \\nstood musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked him \\nwhat it was he studied upon. At last, says he, \" Me see such \\nboat like come to place at my nation.\" I did not understand \\nhim a good while ; but, at last, when I had examined further \\ninto it, I understood by him, that a boat, such as that had \\nbeen, came on shore iipon the country where he lived. I \\npresently imagined that some European ship must have been \\ncast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and \\ndrive ashore ; but was so dull that I never once thought of \\nmen making their escape from, a wreck thither, much less \\nwhence they might come ; so I only inquired after a descrip- \\ntion of the boat. \\n\\nFriday described the boat to me well enough ; but brought \\nme better to understand him when he added with some \\nwarmth, \" We save the white mans from drown.\" Then I \\npresently asked if there were any white mans, as he called \\nthem, in the boat. \"Yes,\" he said ; \" the boat full of white \\nmans.\" I asked him how many. He told upon his fingers \\nseventeen. I asked him then what became of them ? He \\ntold me, \"They live, they dwell at my nation.\" \\n\\nThis put new thoughts into my head ; for I presently \\nimagined that these might be the men belonging to the ship \\nthat was cast away in the sight of my island, and who, after \\nthe ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably \\nlost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed \\nupon that wild shore among the savages. Upon this I in- \\nquired of him more critically what was become of them. He \\nassured me they still lived there ; that they had been there \\nabout four years ; that the savages left them alone, and gave \\nthem victuals to live on. I asked him how it came to pass \\nthey did not kill them and eat them. He said, \" No, they \\nmake brother with thein ;\" that is, as I understood him, a \\ntruce ; and then he added, \" They no eat mans but when \\nmake the war fight;\" that is to say, they never eat any \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 171 \\n\\nmen but such as come to fight with them, and are taken in \\nbattle. \\n\\nIt was after this some considerable time, that being upon \\nthe top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, \\nI had, in a clear day, discovered the continent of America, \\nthe weather being very serene, Friday looks very earnestly \\ntowards the main land, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a \\njumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some \\ndistance from him. I asked him what was the matter. \" O \\njoy!\" says he; \"Oglad! there see my country, there my \\nnation !\" I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure \\nappeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his counte- \\nnance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to \\nbe in his own country again. This observation of mine put \\na great many thoughts into me, which made me, at first, not \\nso easy about my new man Friday as I was before ; and I \\nmade no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his own \\nnation again, he would not only forget all his religion, but all \\nhis obligation to me, and would be forward enough to give \\nhis countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps, \\nwith a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, \\nat which he might be as merry as he used to be with those \\nof his enemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged \\nthe poor, honest creature very much, for which I was very \\nsorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy increased, and. \\nheld me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not \\nso familiar and kind to him as before: in which I was cer- \\ntainly in the wrong too ; the honest, grateful creature having \\nno thought about it, but what consisted with the bes; prin- \\nciples, both as a religious Christian and as a grateful friend; \\nas appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction. \\n\\nWhile my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was \\nevery day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of \\nthe new thoughts which I suspected were in him ; but I found \\neverything he said was so honest and so innocent, that I \\ncould find nothing to nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite of \\nall my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again; \\nnor did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and there- \\nfore I could not suspect him of deceit. \\n\\nOne clay, walking up the same hill, but the weather being \\nhazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I culled \\n\\n\\n\\n172 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nto him, and said, \"Friday, do not you wish yourself in your \\nown country, your own nation?\" \"Yes,\" he said, \" I be \\nmuch O glad to be at my own nation.\" \" What would you \\ndo there ?\" said I : \" would you turn wild again, eat men\\'s \\nflesh, and be a savage, as you were before ?\" He looked full \\nof concern, and shaking his head, said, \" No, no, Friday tell \\nthem to live good; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat \\n•corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk ; no eat man again.\" \" Why, \\nthen,\" said I to him, \"they will kill you.\" He looked grave \\nat that, and then said, \" No, no, they no kill me, they willing \\nlove learn.\" He meant by this, they would be willing to \\nlearn. He added, they learned much of the bearded mans \\nthat came in the boat. Then I asked him if he would go \\nback to them. He smiled at that, and told me that he could \\nnot swim so far. I told him I would make a canoe for him. \\nHe told me he would go, if I would go with him. \" I go !\\'\\' \\nsays I ; \" why they will eat me if I come there.\" \" No, no,\" \\nsays he, \" me make they no eat you ; me make they much \\nlove you.\" Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind \\nthey were to seventeen white men, who came on shore there \\nin distress. \\n\\nFrom this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, \\nand see if I could possibly join with those bearded men, who, \\nI made no doubt, were Spaniards and Portuguese ; not doubt- \\ning, but, if I could, we might find some method to escape \\nfrom thence, being upon the continent, and a good company \\ntogether, better than I could from an island forty miles off \\nthe shore, alone, and without help. So, after some days, I \\ntook Friday to work again, by way of discourse, and told him \\nI would give him a boat to go back to his own nation; and, \\naccordingly, I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the \\nother side of the island, and having cleared it of water (for I \\nalways kept it sunk in water), I brought it out, showed it \\nhim, and we both went into it. I found he was a most dex- \\nterous fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost \\nas swift again as I could. So when he was in, I said to him, \\n\"Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation?\" He looked \\nvery dull at my saying so ; which it seems was because he \\nthought the boat too small to go so far. I then told him I \\nhad a bigger : so the next day I went to the place where the \\nfirst boat lay which I had made, but which I could not get \\n\\n\\n\\nE0B1NS0X CRUSOE. 173 \\n\\ninto the water. He said that was big enough : but-then, as \\nI had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three and \\ntwenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was \\nrotten. Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and \\nwould carry \"much enough vittle, drink, bread.\" \\n\\nUpon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my de- \\nsign of going over with him to the continent, that I told him \\nwe would go and make one as big as that, and he should go \\nhome in it. He answered not one word, but looked very \\ngrave and sad. I asked him what was the matter with him. \\nHe asked me again, \" Why you angry mad with Friday ? — \\nwhat me done?\" I asked him what he meant. I told him I \\nwas not angry with him at all. \" No angry !\" says he, re- \\npeating the words several times, \" why send Friday home \\naway to my nation?\" \"Why,\" says I, \"Friday, did not \\nyou say you wished you were there?\" \"Yes, yes,\" says- \\nhe, \" wish we both there ; no wish Friday there, no master \\nthere.\" In a word, he would not think of going there with- \\nout me. \"I go there, Friday?\" says I, \"what shall I do \\nthere ?\" He turned very quick upon me at this. \" You do \\ngreat deal much good,\" says he ; \" you teach wild mans be- \\ngood, sober, tame mans ; you tell them know God, pray God, \\nand live new life.\" \"Alas, Friday !\" says I, \"thou knowest \\nnot what thou sayest ; I am but an ignorant man myself.\" — \\n\" Yes, yes,\" says he, \" you teachee me good, you teachee \\nthem good.\" \" No, no, Friday,\" says I, \" you shall go with- \\nout me ; leave me here to live by myself as I did before.\" \\nHe looked confused again at that word ; and running to one of \\nthe hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and \\ngives it to me. \" What must I do with this ?\" says I to him. \\n\" You take kill Friday,\" says he. \" What must I kill you \\nfor ?\" said I again. He returns very quick — \" What do you \\nsend Friday away for ? Take kill Friday, no send Friday \\naway.\" This he spoke so earnestly that I saw tears stand in \\nhis eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost \\naffection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I \\ntold him then, and often after, that I would never send him \\naway from me, if he was willing to stay with me. \\n\\nUpon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled \\naffection to me, and that nothing could part him from me, \\nso I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own. \\n\\n\\n\\n174 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ncountry was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and \\nhis hopes of my doing them good; a thing -which, as I had \\nno notion of myself, so I had not the least thought or inten- \\ntion, or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong \\ninclination to attempting my escape, founded on the suppo- \\nsition gathered from the discourse, that there were seventeen \\nbearded men there ; and therefore, without any more delay, \\nI went to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper to \\nfell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the \\n\"voyage. There were trees enough in the island to have \\nbuilt a little fleet of good large vessels ; but the main thing \\nI looked at was, to get one so near the water that Ave might \\nlaunch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed \\nat first. At last, Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found that \\nhe knew much better than I what kind of food was fittest for \\nit. Friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this tree \\nout, to make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it \\nwith tools ; which, after I had showed how to use, he did \\nvery handily; and in about a month\\'s hard labour, we \\nfinished it and made it very handsome ; especially, when, \\nwith our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut \\nand hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After \\nthis, however, it cost us near a fortnight\\'s time to get her \\nalong, as it were, inch by inch, upon great rollers into the \\nwater : but when she was in, she would have carried twenty \\nmen with great ease. \\n\\nWhen she was in the water, though she was so big, it \\namazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my \\nman Friday could manage her, turn her, and paddle her \\nalong. So I asked him if he would, and if we might, venture \\nover in her. \"Yes,\" he said, \"we venture over in her very \\nwell, it-hough great blow wind.\" However, I had a farther \\ndesign that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast \\nand a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and a cable. As to \\na mast, that was easy enough to get ; so I pitched upon a \\nstraight young cedar tree, which I found near the place, and \\nwhich there were great plenty of in the island, and I set \\nFriday to work to cut it down, and gave him directions how \\nto shape and order it. But as to the sail, that was my parti- \\ncular care. I knew I had pieces of old sails enough ; but as \\nI had had them now six-and-twenty years by me, and had \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 175 \\n\\nnot been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that I \\nshould ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt \\nbut they were all rotten ; and, indeed, most of them were so. \\nHowever, I found two pieces, which appeared pretty good, \\nand with these I went to work ; and with a great deal of \\npains and awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of \\nneedles, \\'I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like \\nwhat we call in England a shoulder of mutton sail, to go \\nwith a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, \\nsuch as usually our ships\\' long-boats sail with, and such as I \\nbest knew how to manage, as it was such a one as I had to \\nthe boat in which I made my escape from Barbary. \\n\\nI was near two months performing this last work, viz., \\nrigging and fitting my mast and sails ; for I finished them \\nvery complete, making a small stay, and a sail, or foresail to \\nit, to assist if we should turn to windward ; and what was \\nmore than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer \\nwith. \\n\\nAfter all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as \\nto what belonged to the navigation of my boat ; for, though \\nhe knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing \\nof what belonged to a sail and a rudder ; and was the most \\namazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in th e \\nsea by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this \\nway or that way, as the course we sailed changed ; I say, \\n■when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. \\nHowever, with a little use, I made all these things familiar to \\nhim, and he became an expert sailor — except that of the com- \\npass, I could make him understand very little. On the other \\nhand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or \\nnever any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for \\na compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, \\nand the shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then \\nnobody cared to stir abroad either by land or sea. \\n\\nI was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my \\ncaptivity in this place ; though the last three years that I had \\nthis creature with me ought rather to be left out of the \\naccount, my habitation being quite of another kind than in \\nall the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing \\nhere with the same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at \\nfirst : and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I \\n\\n\\n\\n17G ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nhad much more so now, having such additional testimonies \\nof the care of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had \\nof being effectually and speedily delivered ; for I had an in- \\nvincible impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance \\nwas at hand, and that I should not be another year in this \\nplace. I went on, however, with my husbandry ; digging, \\nplanting, and fencing, as usual. I gathered and cured my \\ngrapes, and did every necessary thing as before. \\n\\nThe rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when I \\nkept more within doors than at other times. We had stowed \\nour new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her up into \\nthe creek, where I landed my rafts from the ship ; and hauling \\nher up to the shore at high-water mark, I made my man \\nFriday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just \\ndeep enough to give her water to float in ; and then, when \\nthe tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, \\nto keep the water out ; and so she lay dry as to the tide from \\nthe sea : and to keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs \\nof trees, so thick that she was as well thatched as a house ; \\nand thus we waited for the months of November and Decem- \\nber, in which I designed to make my adventure. \\n\\nWhen the settled season began to come in, as the thought \\nof my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing \\ndaily for the voyage. And the first thing I did was to lay \\nby a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our \\nvoyage ; and intended, in a week or a fortnight\\'s time, to open \\nthe dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morning \\nupon something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and \\nbid him to go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle \\nor tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a-week, for \\nthe sake of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not \\nbeen long gone when he came running back, and flew over \\nmy outer wall or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or \\nthe steps he set his feet on ; and before I had time to speak \\nto him, he cries out to me, \" O master ! O master ! O sorrow ! \\nO bad ! \" — \" What\\'s the matter, Friday ?\" says I. \" O yonder \\nthere,\" says he, \"one, two, three canoes; one, two, three!\" \\nBy this way of speaking I concluded there were six ; but on \\ninquiry, I found there were but three. \" Well, Friday,\" says \\nI, \" do not be frightened.\" So I heartened him up as well \\nas I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n177 \\n\\n\\n\\nscared, for nothing ran in his head but that they were \\ncome to look for him, and -would cut him in pieces and eat \\nhim ; and the poor fellow trembled so that I scarcely knew \\nwhat to do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 23 \\n\\nand told him I was in as much danger as he, and that they \\nwould eat me as well as him. \" But,\" says I, \" Friday, we \\nmust resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?\" \"Me \\nshoot,\" says he, \" but there come many great number.\" \" No \\nmatter for that,\" said I again ; \" our guns will fright those \\nthat we do not kill.\" So I asked him whether, if I resolved \\n\\n\\n\\n178 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nto defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and \\ndo just as I bid him. He said, \" Me die, when you bid die, \\nmaster.\" So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and \\ngave him ; for I had been so good a husband of my rum, that \\nI had a great deal left. When he had drunk it, I made him \\ntake the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and \\nloaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol- \\nbullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with \\ntwo slugs, and rive small bullets each ; and my two pistols I \\nloaded with a brace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, \\nas usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. \\nWhen I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective- \\nglass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could \\ndiscover ; and I found quickly by my glass, that there were \\none-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes ; \\nand that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant \\nbanquet upon these three human bodies. I observed also, \\nthat they had landed, not where they had done when Friday \\nmade his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore \\nwas low, and where a thick wood came almost close down to \\nthe sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand \\nthese wretches eame about, filled me with such indignation \\nthat I came down again to Friday, and told him I was re- \\nsolved to go down to them, and kill them all ; and asked him \\nif he would stand by me. He had now got over his fright, \\nand his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given \\nhim, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would \\ndie when I bid die. \\n\\nIn this fit of fury I divided the arms which 1 had charged, \\nas before, between us ; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in \\nhis girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder, and I took one \\npistol and the other three guns myself; and in this posture \\nwe marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, \\nand gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets; \\nand as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and \\nnot to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the \\nmeantime not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a \\ncompass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over \\nthe creek as to get into the wood, so that I could come within \\nshot of them before I should be discovered, which I had irn \\nby my glass it was ea*y to do. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 179\\' \\n\\nWhile I was making this march, my former thoughts re- \\nturning, I began to abate my resolution: I do not mean that \\nI entertained any fear of their number, for, as they were \\nnaked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them \\n— nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my \\nthoughts, what occasion, much less what necessity, I was in \\nto go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had \\nneither done or intended me any wrong? who, as to me, \\nwere innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their own \\ndisaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God\\'s having left \\nthem, with the other nations of that part of the world, to such \\nstupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did not call me \\nto take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an \\nexecutioner of His justice, — that whenever He thought fit He \\nwould take the cause into His own hands, and by national \\nvengeance punish them as a people for national crimes, but \\nthat, in the meantime, it was none of my business, — that it \\nwas true Friday might justify it, because he was a declared \\nenemy, and in a state of war with those very particular \\npeople, and it was lawful for him to attack them, — but I \\ncould not say the same with regard to myself. These things \\nwere so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I \\nwent, that I resolved I would only go and place myself near \\nthem that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I \\nwould act then as God should direct ; but that unless some- \\nthing offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I \\nwould not meddle with them. \\n\\nWith this resolution I entered the wood, and with all \\npossible wariness, Friday following close at my heels. I \\nmarched till I came to the skirt of the wood on the side \\nwhich was next to them, only that one corner of the wood \\nlay between me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, \\nand showing him a great tree which was just at the corner of \\nthe wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if he \\ncould see tliere plainly what they were doing. He did so, \\nand came immediately back to me, and told me they might \\nbe plainly viewed there, — that they were all about their fire \\neating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay \\nbound upon the sand a little from them, whom he said they \\nwould kill next, and this fired the very soul within me. He \\ntold me it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded \\n\\n\\n\\n180 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nmen he had told me of, that came to their country in the \\nboat. I was filled with horror at the very naming of the \\nwhite-bearded man ; and going to the. tree, I saw plainly by \\nmy glass a white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea with \\nhis hands and his feet tied, and that he was an European, and \\nhad clothes on. \\n\\nThere was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, \\nabout fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, \\nwhich, by going a little way about, I saw I might come at \\nundiscovered, and that then I should be within half a shot of \\nthem ; so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged \\nto the highest degree: and going back about twenty paces, I \\ngot behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came \\nto the other tree, and then came to a little rising ground, \\nwhich gave me a full view of them at the distance of about \\neighty yards. \\n\\nI had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dread- \\nful wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, \\nand had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, \\nand bring him perhaps limb by limb to their fire, and they \\nwere stooping down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned \\nto Friday : — \" Now, Friday,\" said I, \" do as I bid thee.\" \\nFriday said he would. \" Then, Friday,\" says I, \" do exactly \\nas you see me do ; fail in nothing.\" So I set down one of the \\nmuskets and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday \\ndid the like by his, and with the other musket I took my aim \\nat the savages, bidding him to do the like ; then asking him \\nif he was ready, he said, \" Yes.\" \" Then fire at them,\" said I ; \\nand at the same moment I fired also. \\n\\nFriday took his aim so much better than I, that on the \\nside that he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three \\nmore ; and on my side I killed one, and wounded two. They \\nwere, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation ; and all \\nof them that were not hurt, jumped upon their feet, but did \\nnot immediately know which way to run, or which way to \\nlook, for they knew not from whence their destruction came. \\nFriday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, \\nhe might observe what I did ; so, as soon as the first shot was \\nmade, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, \\nand Friday did the like ; he saw me cock and present ; he \\ndid the same again. \"Ar« vou ready, Friday?\" said I. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 181 \\n\\n\"Yes,\" says he. \"Let fly, then,\" says I, \"in the name of \\nGod !\" and with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, \\nand so did Friday ; and as our pieces were now loaded with \\nwhat I call swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only \\ntwo drop ; but so many were wounded, that they ran about \\nyelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and \\nmost of them miserably wounded, whereof three more fell \\nquickly after, though not quite dead. \\n\\n\" Now, Friday,\" says I, laying down the discharged pieces, \\nand taking up the musket which was yet loaded, \" follow me,\" \\nwhich he did with a great deal of courage ; upon which I \\nrushed out of the wood and showed myself, and Friday close \\nat my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted \\nas loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running \\nas fast as possible towards the poor victim, who was lying \\nupon the beach between the place where they sat and the sea. \\nThe two butchers, who were just going to work with him, had \\nleft at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible \\nfright to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three \\nmore of the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, \\nand bade him step forwards and fire at them ; he understood \\nme immediately, and running about forty yards, to be nearer, \\nhe shot ; and I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them \\nall fall of a heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up \\nagain quickly ; however, he killed two of thorn, and wounded \\nthe third so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if \\nhe had been dead. \\n\\nWhile my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife \\nand cut the flags that bound the poor victim ; and loosing his \\nhands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portu- \\nguese tongue, what he was. He answered in Latin, Christi- \\nanus ; but was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand \\nor speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him, \\nmaking signs that he should drink, which he did ; and I gave \\nhim a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asKed him what \\ncountryman he was: and he said Espagniole; and being a \\nlittle recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly \\nmake, how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. \\n\" Seignior,\" said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, \\n\" we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now : if you \\nhave any strength .left, take this pistol and sword, and lay \\n\\n\\n\\n182 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nabout you.\" Ho took them very thankfully ; and no sooner \\nhad he the arras in his hands, but, as if they had put new- \\nvigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and \\nhad cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is, \\nas the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures \\nwere so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that \\nthey fell down for mere amazement and fear, and had no more \\npower to attempt their own escape, than their flesh had to \\nresist our shot: and that was the case of those five that \\n.Friday shot at in the boat ; for as three of them fell with the \\nhurt they received, so the other two fell with the fright. \\n\\nI kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being \\nwilling to keep my charge ready, because I had given tne \\nSpaniard my pistol and sword: so I called to Friday, and \\nbade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, and \\nfetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged, \\nwhich he did with great swiftness: and then giving him my \\nmusket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade \\nthem come to me when they wanted. While I was loading \\nthese pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between the \\nSpaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with one \\nof their great wooden swords, the weapon that was to have \\nkilled him before, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, \\nwho was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though weak, \\nhad fought the Indian a good while, and had cut two great \\nwounds on his head ; but the savage being a stout, lusty \\nfellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down, being \\nfaint, and was wringing my sword out of his hand ; when the \\nSpaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew \\nthe pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, \\nand killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to \\nhelp him, could come near. \\n\\nFriday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying \\nwretches, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and \\nwith that he despatched those three who, as I said before, \\nwere wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could \\ncome up with : and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun) I \\ngave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued \\ntwo of the savsges, and wounded them both ; but, as he was \\nnot able to run, they both got from him into the wood, where \\nFriday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the other \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 183 \\n\\nwas too nimble for him; and though he was -wounded, yet \\nhad plunged himself into the sea, and swam with all his might \\noff to those two who were left in the canoe, which three in \\nthe canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he \\ndied or no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. \\nThe account of the whole is as follows : — three killed at our \\nfirst shot from the tree ; two killed at the next shot ; two \\nkilled by Friday in the boat ; two killed by Friday, of those \\nat first wounded ; one killed by Friday in the wood ; three \\nkilled by the Spaniard ; four killed, being found dropped here \\nand there, of the wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of \\nthem ; four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not \\ndead — twenty-one in all. \\n\\nThose that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of \\ngunshot, and though Friday made two or three shots at them, \\nI did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain \\nhave had me take one of their canoes, and pursue them ; and, \\nindeed, I was very anxious about their escape, lest carrying \\nthe news home to their people, they should come back perhaps \\nwith two or three hundred of the canoes and devour us by \\nmere multitude ; so I consented to pursue them by sea, and \\nrunning to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday \\nfollow me : but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to \\nfind another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as \\nthe Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with \\nfear, not knowing what was the matter ; for he had not been \\nable to looii up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard \\nneck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really \\nbut little life in him. \\n\\nI immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they \\nhad bound him with, and would have helped him up ; but he \\ncould not stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, be- \\nlieving, it seems, still, that he was only unbound in order to \\nbe killed. When Friday came to him I bade him speak to \\nhim, and tell him of his deliverance ; and pulling out my \\nbottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram ; which, with \\nthe news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in \\nthe bdat. But when Friday came to hear him speak, and look \\nin his face, it would have moved any one to tears to have seen \\nhow Friday kissed him, embraced and hugged him, cried, \\nlaughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung ; then cried \\n\\n\\n\\n184 EOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nagain, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head; and \\nthen sung and jumped about again, like a distracted creature. \\nIt was a good while before I could make him speak or tell me \\nwhat was the matter ; but when he came a little to himself, \\nhe told me that it was his father. \\n\\nIt is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see \\nwhat ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor \\nsavage at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered \\nfrom death; nor, indeed, can I describe half tne extrava- \\ngances of his affection after this ; for he went into the boat, \\nand out of the boat, a great many times : when he went in to \\nhim, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his \\nfather\\'s head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to \\nnourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which were \\nnumbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed \\nthem with his hands ; and I, perceiving what the case was, \\ngave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which \\ndid them a great deal of good. \\n\\nThis affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the \\nother savages, who were now almost out of sight ; and it was \\nhappy ;or us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two \\nhours after, and before they could be got a quarter of their \\nway, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that from \\nthe north-west, which was against them, that I could not sup- \\npose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their own \\ncoast. \\n\\nBut to return to Friday ; he was so busy about his father, \\nthat I could not find in my heart to take him off for some \\ntime ; but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called \\nhim to me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to \\nthe highest extreme ; then I asked him if he had given his \\nfather any bread. He shook his head, and said, \"None: \\nugly dog eat all up self.\" I then gave him a cake of bread, out \\nof a little pouch I carried on purpose ; I also gave him a dram \\nfor himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his \\nfather. I had in my pocket two or three bunches of raisins, \\nso I gave him a hnndful of them for his father. He had no \\nsooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him come out \\nof the boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched, for \\nhe was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw : I say, \\nhe ran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n185 \\n\\n\\n\\nan instant ; and though I called, and hallooed out too, after \\nhim, it was all one — away he went ; and in a quarter of an \\nhour I saw him come back again, though not so fast as he \\nwent ; and, as he came nearer, I found his pace slacker, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 238, \\n\\nbecause he had something in his hand. When he came up to \\nme, I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug, to \\nbring his father some fresh water, and that he had got two \\nmore loaves of bread : the bread he gave me, but the water \\nhe carried to his father ; however, as I was very thirsty too, \\nI took a little of it. The water revived his father more than \\n\\n\\n\\n18G ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nail the rum or spirits I had given him, for he was fainting with \\nthirst. \\n\\nWhen his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there \\nwas any water left : he said \" Yes ;\" and I bride him give it \\nto the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his \\nfather ; and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to \\nthe Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was repos- \\ning himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree ; \\nand whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled \\nwith the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw \\nthat upon Friday\\'s coining to him with the water, he sat up \\nand drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went to \\nhim and gave him a handful of raisins : he looked up in my \\nface with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that \\ncould appear in any countenance ; but was so weak, notwith- \\nstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could \\nnot stand up upon his feet ; he tried to do it two or three \\ntimes, but was really not able, hi* ankles were so swelled and \\nso painful to him ; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday \\nto rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done \\nhis father\\'s. \\n\\nI observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, \\nturn his head about, to see if his father, was in the same place \\nand posture as he left him sitting ; and at last he found he \\nwas not to be seen; at which he started up, and, without \\nspeaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that one \\ncould scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went: \\nbut when he came he only found he had laid himself down to \\nease his limbs, so Friday came back to me presently ; and \\nthen I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he \\ncould, and lead him to the boat, and then he should carry \\nhim to our dwelling, where I would take care of him. But \\nFriday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon his \\nback, and carried him away to the boat, and set him down \\nsoftly upon the side of the canoe, with his feet in the inside \\nof it ; and then lifting him quite in, he set him close to his \\nfather ; and presently stepping out again, launched the boat \\noff, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk: \\nso he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving \\nthem in the boat, ran away to fetch the other -canoe. As he \\npassed me I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 187 \\n\\nHe told me, \" Go fetch more boat : \" so away he went like the \\nwind ; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon \\nas I got to it by land ; so ho wafted me over, and then went \\nto help our new guests out of the boat, which he did ; but \\nthey were neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday \\nknew not what to do. \\n\\nTo remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling \\nto Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to \\nme, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, \\nand Friday and I carried them both up together upon it \\nbetween us. \\n\\nBut when we got them to the outside of our wall, we were \\nat a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them \\nover, and I was resolved not to break it down, so I set to \\nwork again : and Friday and I, in about two hours\\' time, \\nmade a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above \\nthat with boughs of trees, being in the space without our \\noutward fence, and between that and the grove of young wood \\nwhich I had planted ; and here we made them two beds of \\nsuch things as I had, viz., of good riee-straw, with blankets \\nlaid upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed. \\n\\nMy island was now peopled, and I thought myself very \\nrich in subjects ; and it was a merry reflection, which I fre- \\nquently made, how like a king I looked. \\n\\nAs soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, \\nand given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I \\nbegan to think of making some provision for them ; and the \\nfirst thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, \\nbetwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be \\nkilled; whan I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it \\ninto small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, \\nand made them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and \\nbroth ; and as I cooked it without doors, so I carried it all \\ninto the new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat \\ndown, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as well as \\nI could, cheered and encouraged them. \\n\\nAfter we had dined, I ordered Friday to take one of the \\ncanoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms, \\nwhich, for want of time, we had left upon the place of battle ; \\nand, the next day, I ordered him to go and bury the dead \\nbodies of the savages. I also ordered hiin to bury the horrid \\n\\n\\n\\n188 ROBINSON CRUSOE \\n\\nremains of their barbarous feast : all which he punctually per- \\nformed, and effaced the very appearance of the savages being \\nthere ; so that when I went again, I could scarce know where \\nit was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to \\nthe place. \\n\\nI then began to enter into a little conversation with my two \\nnew subjects : and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father \\nwhat he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, \\nand whether we might expect a return of them, witli a power \\ntoo great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the \\nsavages in the boat never could live out the storm which \\nblew that night they went off, but must, of necessity, bo \\ndrowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they \\nwere as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if \\nthey were to be cast away : but, as to what they would do, if \\nthey came safe on shore, he said he knew not ; but it was his \\nopinion, that they were so dreadfully frightened with the \\nmanner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that \\nhe believed they would tell the people they were all killed by \\nthunder and lightning, not by the hand of man ; and that the \\ntwo which appeared, viz., Friday and I, were two heavenly \\nspirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not men \\nwith weapons. This, he said, he knew ; because he heard \\nthem all cry out so, in their language, one to another; for it \\nwas impossible for them to conceive that a man could dart \\nfire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting \\nup the hand, as was done now : and this old savage was in \\nthe right; for, as I understood since, by other hands, the \\nsavages never attempted to go over to the island afterwards, \\nthey were so terrified with the accounts given by those four \\nmen (for it seems they did escape the sea), that they believed \\nwhoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed \\nwith fire from the gods. This, however, I knew not ; and, \\ntherefore, was under continual apprehensions for a good while, \\nand kept always upon my guard, with all my army ; for, as \\nthere were now four of us, I would have ventured upon a \\nhundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time. \\n\\nIn a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the \\nfear of their coming wore off; and I began to take my former \\nthoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration ; being \\nlikewise assured, by Friday\\'s father, that I might depend upon \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 189 \\n\\ngood usage from their nation, on his account, if I would go. \\nBut my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious \\ndiscourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that \\nthere were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, \\nwho having been cast away and made their escape to that \\nside, lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were \\nvery sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed, for life. I \\nasked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found they \\nwere a Spanish ship, bound from the Kio de la Plata to the \\nHavanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which \\nwas chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what European \\ngoods they could meet with there ; that they had five Portu- \\nguese seamen on board, whom they took out of another \\nwreck ; that five of their own men were drowned, when first \\nthe ship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite \\ndangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the can- \\nnibal coast, where they expected to have been devoured every \\nmoment. He told me they had some arms with them, but \\nthey were perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder \\nnor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder, \\nbut a little, which they used at their first landing, to provide \\nthemselves some food. \\n\\nI asked him what he thought would become of them there, \\nand if they had formed any design of making their escape. \\nHe said they had many consultations about it ; but that having \\nneither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any \\nkind, their councils always ended in tears and despair. I \\nasked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from \\nme, which might tend towards an escape ; and whether, if they \\nwere all here, it might not be done. I told him, with freedom, \\nI feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put \\nmy life in their hands ; for that gratitude was no inherent \\nvirtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square their \\ndealings by the obligations they had received, so much as they \\ndid by the advantages they expected. \\n\\nHe answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuous- \\nness, that their condition was so miserable, and that they were \\nso sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought \\nof using any man unkindly that should contribute to their \\ndeliverance ; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them, with \\nthe old man, and discourse with them about it, and return \\n\\n\\n\\n190 \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nagain, and bring me their answer; that he would make con- \\nditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be \\nabsolutely under my direction, as their commander and cap- \\ntain : and they should swear upon the holy sacraments and \\ngospel to be true to me, and go to such Christian country as \\nI should agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly \\nand absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in \\nsuch country as I intended ; and that he would bring a con- \\ntract from them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then \\nhe told me he would first swear to me himself, that he would \\nnever stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him orders ; \\nand that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood, \\nif there should happen the least breach of faith among his \\ncountrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil, \\nhonest men, and they were under the greatest distress imagi- \\nnable, having neither weapons or clothes, nor any food, but at \\nthe mercy and discretion of the savages ; out of all hopes of \\never returning to their own country ; and that he was sure, \\nif I would undertake their relief, they would live and die \\nby me. \\n\\nUpon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve \\nthem, if possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard \\nover to them to treat. But when we had got all things in \\nreadiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, \\nwhich had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much \\nsincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well \\nsatisfied in it ; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of \\nhis comrades for at least half a year. The case vas thus : he \\nhad been with us now about a month, during which time I \\nhad let him see in what manner I had provided, with the \\nassistance of Providence, for my support ; and he saw evi- \\ndently what stock of corn and rice I had laid up: which, \\nthough it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not \\nsufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was \\nincreased to four ; but much less would it be sufficient if his \\ncountrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should \\ncome over ; and, least of all, would it be sufficient to victual \\nour vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the \\nChristian colonies of America ; so he told me he thought it \\nwould be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and \\ncultivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed to \\n\\n\\n\\nEOEIXSON CRUSOE. 191 \\n\\nsow, and that we should wait another harvest that we might \\nhave a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should \\ncome ; for want might be a temptation to them to disagree, \\nor not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of \\none difficulty into another. \\n\\nHis caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that \\nI could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as u ell \\nas I was satisfied with his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all \\nfour of us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with \\npermitted; and, in about a month\\'s time, by the end of \\nwhich it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and \\ntrimmed up, as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley \\non, and sixteen jars of rice, which was all the seed wo had to \\nspare : indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient for our own \\nfood, for the six months that we had to expect our crop, \\nreckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; \\nfor it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground in \\nthat country. \\n\\nHaving now society enough, and our number being suffi- \\ncient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, \\nunless their number had been very great, we went freely all \\nover the island, whenever we found occasion; and as we had \\nour escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossi- \\nble, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. For \\nthis purpose, I marked out several trees, which I thought fit \\nfor our work, and I set Friday and his father to cut them \\ndown; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted \\nmy thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their work. \\nI showed them with what indefatigable pains I ha\\'d hewed a \\nlarge tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the \\nlike, till they had made about a dozen large planks of good \\noak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two \\ninches to four inches thick : what prodigious labour it took \\nup, anyone may imagine. \\n\\nAt the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of \\ntame goats as much as I could ; and, for this purpose, I madf \\nFriday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with \\nFriday the next day (for we took our turns), and by this \\nmeans we got about twenty young kids to breed up with th< \\nrest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, an\\' \\nadded them to our flock. But, above all, the season f< \\n\\n\\n\\n192 IIOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ncuring the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious \\nquantity to be hung up in the sun, that I believe we could \\nhave filled sixty or eighty barrels ; and these, with our bread, \\nformed a great part of our food. \\n\\nIt was now harvest, and our crop in good order ; it was not \\nthe most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, how- \\never, it was enough to answer our end ; for, from twenty-two \\nbushels of barley, we brought in and threshed out above two \\nhundred and twenty bushels ; and the like in proportion of \\nthe rice, which was store enough for our food to the next \\nharvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore \\nwith me ; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would \\nvery plentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to \\nany part of America. When we had thus housed and secured \\nour magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more great \\nbaskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very \\nhandy and dexterous at this. \\n\\nAnd now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I \\nexpected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, \\nto see what he could do with those he had left behind him \\nthere. I gave him a strict charge not to bring any man with \\nhim who would not first swear, in the presence of himself and \\nthe old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or \\nattack the person he should find in the island, who was so \\nkind as to send for them in order to their deliverance ; but \\nthat they would stand by him and defend him against all such \\nattempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely under \\nand subjected to his command ; and that this should be put \\nin writing, and signed in their hands. How they were to \\nhave done this when I knew they had neither pen or ink, was \\na question we never asked. Under these instructions the \\nSpaniard and the old savage went away in one of the canoes \\nwhich they might be said to come in, or rather were brought \\nin, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the \\nsavages. I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock on it, \\nand about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them \\nto be very good husbands of both, and not to use either of \\nthem but upon urgent occasions. \\n\\nThis was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by \\nme, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years \\nand some days. I gave them provisions of bread, and of \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n103 \\n\\n\\n\\ndried grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and \\nsufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days\\' time ; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrase 21 \\' \\n\\n\\n\\nand wishing them a good voyage, I Saw them go, agreeing \\n■with them \"about a signal they should hang out at their re- \\nturn, by which I should know them acrain vhen they came \\n\\n\\n\\n134 ItOBINSO.V CRUSOE \\n\\nback, at a distance, before thoy came on shore. They went \\naway, with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was at full, \\nby my account in the month of October. \\n\\nIt was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when \\na strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the \\nlike has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast \\nasleep in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday came \\nrunning in to me, and called aloud, \" Master, master, they \\nare come, they are come !\" I jumped up, and, regardless ot \\ndanger, I went out as soon as I could get my clothes on, \\nthrough my little grove, which, by the way, was by this time \\ngrown to be a very thick wood ; I went •without my arms, \\nwhich was not my custom to do : but I was surprised, when, \\nturning my eyes to the jsea, I presently saw a boat at about a \\nleague and a half distance, standing in for the shore, with a \\nshoulder-of-*snitt©n sail, and the wind blowing pretty fair. to \\nbring them in: also I observed, presently, that they did not \\ncome from that fide which the shore lay on, but from the \\nsouthernmost end of the island. Upon this I called Friday in, \\nand bade him lie close, for these were not the people we \\nlooked for, and that we might not know yet whether they \\nwere friends or enemies. In the next plaee, I went in to \\nfetch nvy perspective glass, to see what I could make of them; \\nand, having taken the ladder out, I climbed to the top of the \\nhill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anything - , \\nand to take my view the plainer, without being discovered. I \\nhad scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly \\ndiscovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues and \\na half distance from me, S.S.E., but not abonea league and a \\nhalf from the shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly \\nto be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an Eng- \\nlish long-boat. \\n\\nI cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of \\nseeing a »hip, .and one -that I had reason to believe was \\nmanned by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, \\nwas such as I canno£ describe ; but yet I ■ had some secret \\ndoubts hanging about me, bidding me keep upon my guard. \\nIn the first place, it occurred to me to consider what business \\nan English ship could have in that part of the world, since it \\nwas not the way to or from any part of the world where the \\n-English had any traffic ; and I knew there had been no storms \\n\\n\\n\\nkobixso:,\\' ciiusoe. 195 \\n\\nto drive them in there, in distress ; and that if they were \\nreally English, it was most probable that they were here \\nupon no good design ; and that I had better continue as I \\nwas, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers. \\n\\nHad I not been made cautious, I had been undone inevi- \\ntably, and in a far worse condition than before, as you will see \\npresently. I had not kept myself long in this posture, till I \\nsaw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a \\ncreek to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing ; however, \\nas they did not come quite far enough they did not see the \\nlittle inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but run their \\nboat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, \\n■which was very happy for me ; for otherwise they would have \\nlanded just at my door, as I may say, and would soon have \\nbeaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me \\nof all I had. When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied \\nthey were Englishmen, at least most of them ; one or two I \\nthought were Dutch, but it did not prove so ; there were in \\nall eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed, \\nand, as I thought, bound ; and when the first four or five of \\nthem jumped on shore, they took those throe out of the boat, \\nas prisoners : one of the three I could perceive, using the \\nmost passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, \\neven to a kind of extravagance ; the other two, I could per- \\nceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned, \\nindeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was perfectly \\nconfounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of \\nit should be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as \\nhe could, \" master ! you see English mans eat prisoner as \\nwell as savage mans.\" \" Why, Friday,\" says I, \" do you \\nthink they are going to eat them then ?\" \" Yes,\" says Friday, \\n\" they will eat them.\" \" No, no,\" says I, \" Friday ; I am \\nafraid they will murder them, indeed ; but you may be sure \\nthey will not eat them.\" \\n\\nAll this while I had no thought of what the matter really \\nwas, but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, ex- \\npecting every moment when the three prisoners should be \\nkilled ; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arms \\n■with a great cutlass, to strike one of the poor men ; and I \\nexpected to see him fall every moment; at which all the blood \\nin my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I wished \\n\\n\\n\\n196 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nheartily now for the Spaniard, and the savage that was gone \\nwith him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered \\nwithin shot of them, that I might have secured the three men, \\nfor I saw they had among them no fire-arms ; but it fell out \\nto my mind another way. After I had observed the out- \\nrageous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, the \\nfellows ran scattering about the island, as if they wanted to \\nsee the country. I observed that the three other men had \\nliberty to go also where they pleased ; but they sat down all \\nthree upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in \\ndespair. \\n\\nIt was just at high water when these people came on shore , \\nand while they rambled about to see what kind of a place \\n\"they were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide was spent, \\nand the water was ebbed considerably away, leaving their \\nboat aground. They had left two men in the boat, who, as I \\nfound afterwards, having drunk a little too much brandy, fell \\nasleep ; however, one of them waking a little sooner than the \\nother, and finding the boat too far aground for him to stir it, \\nhallooed out for the rest, who were straggling about ; upon \\nwhich they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all \\ntheir strength to launch her, being very heavy, and the shore \\non that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. \\nIn this condition they gave it over, and away they strolled \\nabout the country again ; and I heard one of them say aloud \\nto another, calling them off from the boat, \" Why, let her \\nalone, Jack, can\\'t you ? she\\'ll float next tide :\" by which I \\nwas fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen \\nthey were. All this while I kept myself very close, not once \\ndaring to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place \\nof observation, near the top of the hill ; and very glad I was \\nto think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than \\nten hours before the boat could float again, and by that time \\nit would be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their \\nmotions, and to hear their discourse, if they had any. In the \\nmeantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though \\nwith more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of \\nenemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I \\nhad made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself \\nwith arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him \\nthree muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce ; I had my \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CUUSOE. 197 \\n\\nformidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have men- \\ntioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and \\na gun upon each shoulder. \\n\\nIt was my design, as I said above, not to have made any \\nattempt till it was dark ; but about two o\\'clock, being the \\nheat of the day, I found that they were all gone straggling \\ninto the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to sleep. The \\nthree poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to \\nget any sleep, had, however, sat clown under the shelter of a \\ngreat tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I \\nthought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved \\nto discover myself to them, and learn something of their con- \\ndition : immediately I marched, my man Friday at a good \\ndistance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not \\nmaking quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came \\nas near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any \\nof them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, \" What \\nare ye, gentlemen ? \" They started up at the noise, but were \\nten times more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth \\nfigure that I made. They made no answer at all, but I thought \\nI perceived them just going to fly from me, when 1 spoke to \\nthem in English. \" Gentlemen,\" said I, \" do not be surprised \\nat me ; perhaps you may have a friend near when you did \\nnot expect it.\" \" He must be sent directly from Heaven \\nthen,\" said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off \\nhis hat at the same time to me ; \" for our condition is past the \\nhelp of man.\" li All help is from Heaven, sir,\" said I : \" but \\ncan you put a stranger in the way to help you? for you seem \\nto be in some great distress. I saw you when you landed ; \\nand when you seemed to make application to the brutes that \\ncame with vou, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill \\n\\nyou.\" \\n\\nThe poor man, with tears running down his face, and \\ntrembling, looked like one astonished, returned, \" Am I talking \\nto God or man ? Is it a real man or an angel ? \" \" Be in no \\nfear about that, sir,\" said I ; \"if God had sent an angel to \\nrelieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed \\nafter another manner than you see me. Pray lay aside your \\nfears ; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you. \\nYou see I have one servant only ; we have arms and ammuni- \\ntion : tell us freely, can we serve you ? What is your case ? : \\' \\n\\n\\n\\n198 \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n\" Our case, sir,\" said he, \" is too long to tell you, while our \\nmurderers are so near us ; but, in short, sir, I was commander \\nof that ship ; my men have mutinied against me ; they have \\nbeen hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have \\nset me on shore in this desolate place, with these two men \\nwith me — one my mate, the other a passenger, where we ex- \\npected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and \\nknow not yet what to think of it.\" \" Where are these brutes, \\nyour enemies ? \" said I ; \"do you know where they are gone ? \" \\n\"There they lie, sir,\" said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; \\n\"my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard you \\nspeak ; if they have, they will certainly murder us all.\" \\n\" Have they any fire-arms ? \" said I. He answered, \" They \\nhad only two pieces, one of which they left in the boat.\" \\n\" Well, then,\" said I, \" leave the rest to me. I see they are \\nall asleep ; it is an easy thing to kill them all ; but shall we \\nrather take them prisoners?\" He told me there were two \\ndesperate villains among them that it was scarce safe to show \\nany mercy to ; but if they were secured, he believed all the \\nrest would return to their duty. I asked him which they \\nwere ? He told me he could not at that distance distinguish \\nthem, but he would obey my orders in anything I would \\ndirect. \" Well,\" says I, \" let us retreat out of their view or \\nhearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further.\" So \\nthey willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us \\nfrom them. \\n\\n\" Look you, sir,\" said I, \" if I venture upon your deliver- \\nance, are you willing to make two conditions with me?\" He \\nanticipated my proposals by telling me that both he and the \\nship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded \\nby me in everything ; and if the ship was not recovered, he \\nwould live and die with me in what part of the world soever \\nI would send him ; and the two other men said the same. \\n\"Well,\" says I, \"my conditions are but two; first, — that \\nwhile you stay in this island with me, you will not pretend to \\nany authority here ; and if I put arms in your hands, you \\nwill, upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no pre- \\njudice to me or mine upon this island, and in the meantime \\nb» governed by my orders ; secondly, — that if the ship is \\nrecovered, you will carry me and my man to England passage \\nfree,\" \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSOX CRUSOE. 199 \\n\\nHe gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith \\nof man could devise that he would comply with these most \\nreasonable demands, and besides would owe his life to me v \\nand acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived. \\n\" Well, then,\" said I, \" here are three muskets for you, with \\npowder and ball ; tell me next what you think is proper to be \\ndone.\" He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that \\nhe was able, but offered to be wholly guided by me. I told \\nhim I thought it was hard venturing anything ; but the best \\nmethod I could think of was to fire on them at once as they \\nlay, and if any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to \\nsubmit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God\\'s \\nprovidence to direct the shot. He said, very modestly, that \\nhe was loath to kill them, if he could help it ; but that those \\ntwo were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all \\nthe mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be \\nundone still, for they would go on board and bring the whole \\nship\\'s company, and destroy us all. \"Well, then,\" says I, \\n<l necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way to \\nsave our lives.\" However, seeing him still cautious of shed- \\nding blood, I told him ihey should go themselves, and manage \\nas they found convenient. \\n\\nIn the middle of this discourse we heard some of them \\nawake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I \\nasked him if either of them were the heads of tne mutiny ? \\nHe said, \" No.\" \" Well, then,\" said I, \" you may let them \\nescape ; and Providence seems to have awakened them on \\npurpose to save themselves. Now,\" says I, \" if the rest escape \\nyou, it is your fault.\" Animated with this, he took the \\nmusket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, \\nand his two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand; \\nthe two men who were with him going first made some nois, \\nat which one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about, \\nand seeing them coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too \\nlate then, for the moment lie cried out they fired — I mean the \\ntwo men, the captain wisely reserving his own piece. They \\nhad so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one \\nof them was killed on the spot, and the other very much \\nw.Hiu<led ; but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and \\ncalled eagerly for help to the other; but the captain, stepping \\nto him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call \\n\\n\\n\\n200 KOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nupon God to forgive his villany, and with that word knocked \\nhim down with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke \\nmore: there were three more in the company, and one of \\nthem was slightly wounded. By this time I was come ; and \\nwhen they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, \\nthey begged for mercy. The captain told them he would spare \\ntheir lives if they would give him an assurance of their abhor- \\nrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would \\nswear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and after- \\nwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, whence they came. \\nThey gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that \\ncould be desired : and he was willing to believe them, and \\nspare their Jives, which I was not against, only that I obliged \\nhim to keep them bound hand and foot while they were on \\nthe island. \\n\\nWhile this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain\\'s mate \\nto the boat with orders to secure her, and bring away the \\noars and sails, which they did ; and by-and-by three straggling \\nmen, that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came \\nback upon hearing the guns fired ; and seeing the captain, \\nwho was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they \\nsubmitted to be bound also ; and so our victory was complete. \\n\\nIt now remained that the captain and I should inquire into \\none another\\'s circumstances. I began first, and told him my \\n■whole history, which he heard with an attention even to \\namazement, — and particularly at the wonderful manner of my \\nbeing furnished with provisioiJf and ammunition ; and, indeed, \\nas my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him \\ndeeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself, \\nand how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to \\nsave his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not \\nspeak a word more. After this communication was at an end, \\nI carried him and his two men into my apartment, leading \\nthem in just whore I came out, viz., at the top of the house, \\nwhere I refreshed him with such provision as I had, and \\nshowed them all the contrivances I had made during my long, \\nlong inhabiting that place. \\n\\nAll I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly \\namazing ; but above all, the captain admired my fortification, \\nand how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of \\ntrees, which, having been now planted near twenty years, and \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBIXSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n201 \\n\\n\\n\\nlittl \\\\2 TOW1 °S ™ U J ?- ter than iQ En 3 land > ™ s become a \\nlittle wood, so thick that it was impassable in anv part of it \\n\\nbut at that one skie where I had reserved my little^indrn- \\n\\npu^age into it I told him this was mv castle and m S \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni™\\'^1Lnt a r\\\\ in ih ° «\"\">**«■«■\">•* princes \\n\\nKt ! r ! eat upon occasion \\' and I would show \\n\\ntoln 1 Lvf tlme; , but at P resent our busi »« s ™ \\nto that but S T Ver thG Ship - He a S reed with ™ «• \\n\\n«o take, for that there were still sk-aml-twenty hands on \\n\\n\\n\\n202 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nboard, who, having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which \\nthey had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened \\nin it now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that \\nif they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows as \\nsoon as they came to England, or to any of the English \\ncolonies, and that therefore there would be no attacking them \\nwith so small a number as we were. \\n\\nI mused for some time upon what he had said, and found \\nit was a very rational conclusion, and that therefore something \\nwas to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the men on \\nboard into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their \\nlanding upon us, and destroying us. Upon this, it presently \\noccurred to me that -in a little while the ship\\'s crew, wonder- \\ning what was become of their comrades and of the boat, \\nwould certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for \\nthem, and that then perhaps they might come armed, and be \\ntoo strong for us ; this he allowed to be rational. Upon this, \\nI told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat, \\nwhich lay upon the beach, so that they might not carry her \\noff, and taking everything out of her,, leave her so far useless \\nas not to be fit to swim ; accordingly, we went on board, took \\nthe arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever \\nelse we found there, — which was a bottle of brandy, and \\nanother of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a \\ngreat lump of sugar in a piece of canvas, all which was very \\nwelcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I \\nhad had none left for many years. \\n\\nWhen we had carried all these things on shore, we knocked \\na great hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough \\nto master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, \\nit was not much in my thoughts that we could be able to \\nrecover the ship ; but my view was, that if they went away \\nwithout the boat, I did not much question to make her again \\nfit to carry us to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our \\nfriends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my \\nthoughts. \\n\\nWhile we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, \\nby main strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high \\nthat the tide would not float her off at high water mark, and \\nbe31O.es, had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly \\nstopped, and were set down musing what we should do, we \\n\\n\\n\\n• EOBINSOX CRUSOE. 203 \\n\\nheard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her ensign as \\na signal for the boat to come on board : but no boat stirred ; \\nand they fired several times, making other signals for the \\nboat. At last, when all their signals and firing proved fruit- \\nless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by \\nthe help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row to- \\nwards the shore; and we found, as they approached, that \\nthere were no less than ten men in her, and that they had \\nfire-arms with them. \\n\\nAs the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had \\na full view of them as they came, and a plain sight even of \\ntheir faces ; because the tide having set them a little to the \\neast of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to \\nthe same place where the other had landed, and where the \\nboat lay ; the captain knew the persons and characters of all \\nthe men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very \\nhonest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspi- \\nracy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened ; but that \\nas for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief officer among \\nthem, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the \\nship\\'s crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their now \\nenterprise ; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would \\nbe too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him that \\nmen in our circumstances were past the operation of fear. I \\nasked lrim what he thought of the circumstances of my life, \\nand whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for ? \\n\" And where, sir,\" said I, \" is your belief of my being pre- \\nserved here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you \\na little while ago ? For my part,\" said I, \" there seems to be \\nbut one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.\" \" What is \\nthat V says he. \" Why,\" said I, \" it is, that as you say there \\nare three or four honest fellows among them, which should be \\nspared, had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I \\nshould have thought God\\'s providence had singled them out \\nto deliver them into your hands ; for depend upon it every \\nman that comes ashore is our own, and shall die or live as \\nthey behave to us.\" As I spoke this with a raised voice and \\ncheerful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged \\'him ; so \\nwe set vigorously to our business. \\n\\nWe had, upon the first appearance of the boats coming \\nfrom the ship, considered of separating our prisoners ; and we \\n\\n\\n\\n204 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nhad, indeed, secured them effectually. Two of them, of whom \\nthe captain was less assured, I sent with Friday, and one of \\nthe three delivered men, to my cave, where they were remote \\nenough, and out of danger of being heard or discovered, or \\nof finding their way out of the woods if they could have de- \\nlivered themselves : here they left them bound, but gave them \\nprovisions ; and promised them, if they continued there \\nquietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two ; but that \\nif they attempted their escape, they should be put to death \\n\"without mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their con- \\nfinement with patience, and were very thankful that they had \\nsuch good usage as to have provisions and light left them ; \\nfor Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for \\ntheir comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sen- \\ntinel over them at the entrance. \\n\\nThe other prisoners had better usage ; two of them were \\nkept pinioned, because the captain was not able to trust them ; \\nbut the two other were taken into my service, upon the cap- \\ntain\\'s recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to \\nlive and die with us ; so with them and the three honest men \\nwe were seven men, well armed ; and I made no doubt we \\nshould be able to deal well enough with the ten that were \\ncoming, considering that the captain had said there were three \\nor four honest men among them also. As soon as they got \\nto the place where their other boat lay, they ran thejr boat \\ninto the beach and came all on shore, hauling the boat up \\nafter them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they \\nwould rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from \\nthe shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should \\nnot be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing \\nthey did, they ran all to their other boat ; and it was easy to \\nsee they were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as \\nabove, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. \\nAfter they had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or \\nthree great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if \\nthey could make their companions hear ; but all was to no \\npurpose : then they came all close in a ring, and fired a vol- \\nley of their small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the \\nechoes made the woods ring. They were so astonished at the \\nsurprise of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved \\nto go all on aboard again to their ship, and let them know \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 205 \\n\\nthat the men were all murdered, and the long-boat staved ; \\naccordingly, they immediately launched their boat again, and \\ngot all of them on board. \\n\\nThe captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at \\nthis, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set \\nsail, giving their comrades over for lost, and so he should still \\nlose the ship, which he was in hopes we should have re- \\ncovered ; but he was quickly as much frightened the other \\nway. \\n\\nThey had not been long put off with the boat, when we \\nperceived them all coming on shore again : but with this new \\nmeasure in their conduct, which it seems they consulted to- \\ngether upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat, and the rest \\nto go on shore, and go up into the country to look for their \\nfellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now we \\nwere at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on \\nshore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape ; \\nbecause they would row away to the ship, and then the rest \\nof them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our re- \\ncovering the ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy \\nbut to wait and see what the issue of things might present. \\nThe seven men came on shore, and the three who remained \\nin the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and \\ncame to an anchor to wait for them ; so that it was impossible \\nfor us to come at them in the boat. Those that came on \\nshore kept close together, marching towards the top of the \\nlittle hill under which my habitation lay ; and we could see \\nthem plainly, though they could not perceive us. We should \\nhave been very glad if they would have come nearer to us, \\nso that we might have fired at them, or that they would have \\ngone farther off, that we might come abroad. But when they \\nwere come to the brow of the hill, where they could see a \\ngreat way into the valleys and woods, they shouted and \\nhallooed till they were weary ; and not caring, it seems, to \\nventure far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat \\ndown together under a tree to consider it. \\n\\nThe captain made a very just proposal to me upon this con- \\nsultation of theirs— viz., that perhaps they would all fire a \\nvolley again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and \\nthat we should all sally upon them just at the juncture when \\ntheir pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly \\n\\n\\n\\n206 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nyield, and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked \\nthis proposal, provided it was done while we were near \\nenough to come up to them before they could load their \\npieces again. But this event did not happen ; and we lay \\nstill a long time, very irresolute what course to take. At \\nlength, I told them there would be nothing done, in my \\nopinion, till night ; and then • if they did not return to the \\nboat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and \\nthe shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in the \\nboat to get them on shore. We waited a great while, though \\nvery impatient for their removing ; and were very uneasy \\nwhen, after long consultation, we saw them all start up, and \\nmarch down towards the sea ; it seems they had such dread- \\nful apprehensions of the danger of the place, that they re- \\nsolved to go on board again, give their companions over for \\nlost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship. \\n\\nAs soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I thought \\nof a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered \\nmy end to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain\\'s mate \\nto go over the little creek westward, towards the place where \\nthe savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and so \\nsoon as they came to a little rising ground, at about half a \\nmile distance, I bade them halloo out, as loud as they could, \\nand wait till they found the seamen heard them ; that as soon \\nas ever they heard the seamen answer them, they should re- \\nturn it again ; and then, keeping out of sight, take a round, \\nalways answering when the others hallooed to draw them as \\nfar into the island, and among the woods as possible, and \\nthen wheel about again to me by such ways as I directed \\nthem. \\n\\nThey were just going into the boat when Friday and the \\nmate hallooed : and they presently heard them, and, answer- \\ning, ran along the shore westward, towards the voice they \\nheard, when they were stopped by the creek, where, the \\nwater being up, they could not get over, and called for the \\nboat to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expeettvi. \\nWhen they had set themselves over, I observed that the boar, \\nbeing gone a good way into the creek, they took one of the throe \\nmen out of her to go along with. them, and left only two in \\nthe boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on \\nthe shore. This was what I wished for: and immediately \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE, 207 \\n\\nleaving Friday and the captain\\'s mate to their business, I \\ntook the rest with me, and crossing the creek out of their \\nsight, we surprised the two men before they were aware ; one \\nof them lying on the shore and the other being in the boat. \\nThe fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, anil \\ngoing to start up ; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon \\nhim and knocked him down ; and then called out to him in \\nthe boat to yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very \\nfew arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he \\nsaw five men upon him, and his comrade knocked down : be- \\nsides, this wa3, it seems, one of the three men who were not \\nso hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew ; and, there- \\nfore, was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards \\nto join very sincerely with us. In the meantime, Friday and \\nthe captain\\'s mate so well managed their business with the \\nrest, that they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from \\none hill to another, and from one wood to another, till they \\nnot only heartily tired them, but left them where they were \\nvery sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was \\ndark ; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, \\nby the time they came back to us. \\n\\nWe had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the \\ndark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure, work with \\nthem. It was several hours after Friday came back to me \\nbefore they came back to their boat ; and we could hear the \\nforemost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to \\nthose behind to come along; and could also hear them \\nanswer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and not \\nable to come any faster : which was very welcome news to us. \\nAt length they came up to the boat : but it is impossible to \\nexpress their confusion when they found the boat fast aground \\nin the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. \\nWe could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable \\nmanner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted \\nisland ; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they \\nshould all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits \\nin it, and they should all be carried away and devoured. \\nThey hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their \\nnames a great many times, but no answer. After some time, \\nwe could see them, by the little light there was, run about, \\nwringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes they \\n\\n\\n\\n208 ROBIXSOX CRUSOE. \\n\\nwould go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves : then \\ncome ashore again, and walk about, and so the same thing \\nover again. My men would fain have had me give them \\nleave to fall upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing \\nto take them at some advantage, so as to spare them, and kill \\nas few of them as I could ; and especially I was unwilling to \\nhazard the killing any of our men, knowing the others were \\nvery well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not \\nseparate ; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my \\nambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to \\ncreep upon their hands and feet as close to the ground as they \\ncould, that they might not be discovered, and get as near \\nthem as they could possibly, before they offered to fire. \\n\\nThey had not been long in that posture, when the boat- \\nswain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and \\nhad now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of all \\nthe rest, came walking towards them, with two more of the \\ncrew ; the captain was so eager at having this principal rogue \\nso much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to \\nlet him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard \\nhis tongue before : but when they came nearer, the captain \\nand Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them. The \\nboatswain was killed upon the spot : the next man was shot \\nin the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till \\nan hour or two after ; and the third ran for it. At the noise \\nof the fire, I immediately advanced with my whole army, \\nwhich was now eight men, viz., myself, generalissimo ; Friday, \\nmy lieutenant-general ; the captain and his two men, and the \\nthree prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms. We \\ncame upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not \\nsee our number ; and I made the man they had left in the \\nboat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if \\nI could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps might reduce \\nthem to terms ; which fell out just as we desired : for indeed \\nit was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would \\nbe very willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he \\ncould to one of them, \" Tom Smith ! Tom Smith !\" Tom \\nSmith answered immediately, \"Is that Robinson?\" for it \\nseems he knew the voice. The other answered, \" Ay, ay ; for \\nGod\\'s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield \\nor you are all dead men this moment.\" \" Who mu3t we \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n20V \\n\\n\\n\\nyield to Where are they ?\" says Smith again. \"Here they \\nare,\" says he ; \" here\\'s our captain and -fifty men with him, \\nhave been hunting you these two hours; the boatswain is \\nkilled, Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner ; and if you \\ndo not yield, you are all lost.\" \" Will they give us quarter \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthen ?\" says Tom Smith, \" and we will yield.\" \" I\\'ll go and \\nask, if you promise to yield,\" said Rooinson : so lie asked the \\ncaptain, and the captain himself then calls out, \" You, Smith, \\nyou know my voice ; if you lay down your arms imme- \\ndiately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will \\nAtkins.\" \\n14. \\n\\n\\n\\n210 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nUpon this, Will Atkins cried out, \" For God\\'s sake, captain, \\ngive me quarter ; what have I done ? They have all been as \\nbad as I :\" which, by the way, was not true ; for, it seems, \\nthis Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain, \\nwhen they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying \\nhis hands, and giving him injurious language. However, the \\ncaptain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and \\ntrust to the governor\\'s mercy : by which he meant me, for \\nthey all called me governor. In a word, they all laid down \\ntheir arms, and begged their lives ; and I sent the man that \\nhad parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all ; \\nand then my great army of fifty men, which, with those three, \\nwere in all but eight, came up and seized upon them, and \\nupon their boat ; only that I kept myself and one more out of \\nsight for reasons, of state. \\n\\nOur next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing \\nthe ship : and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley \\nwith them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of \\ntheir practices with him, and upon the further wickedness of \\ntheir design, and how certainly it must bring them to misery \\nand distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They \\nall appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. \\nAs for that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the \\ncommander\\'s of the island ; that they thought they had set \\nhim on shore in a barren uninhabited island; but it had \\npleased God so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that \\nthe governor was an Englishman ; that he might hang them \\nall there, if he pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, \\nhe supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with \\nthere as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was com- \\nmanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for \\nthat he would be hanged in the morning. \\n\\nThough this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its de- \\nsired effect ; Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to \\nintercede with the governor for his life; and all the rest \\nbegged of him, for God\\'s sake, that they might not be sent to \\nEngland. \\n\\nIt now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was \\ncome, ^nd that it would be a most easy thing to bring these \\nfellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship ; so I \\nretired in the dark from them, that they might not see what \\n\\n\\n\\nROEIJfSON CRUSOE. 21 1 \\n\\nkind of a governor they had, and called the captain to me ; \\nwhen I called, at a good distance, one of the men was ordered \\nto speak again, and say to the captain, \" Captain, the com- \\nmander calls for you;\" and presently the captain replied, \\n\" Tell his Excellency I am just coming.\" This more perfectly \\namazed them, and they all believed that the commander was \\njust by, with his fifty men. Upon the captain coining to me, \\nI told, him my project for seizing the ship, which he liked \\nwonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next \\nmorning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to \\nbe secure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, \\nand that he should go and take Atkins, and two more of the \\nworst of them, and send them pinioned to the cave where the \\nothers lay. This was committed to Friday and the two men \\nwho came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them \\nto the cave as to a prison : and it was, indeed, a dismal place, \\nespecially to men in their condition. The others I ordered \\nto my bower ; and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the \\nplace was secure enough, considering they were upon their \\nbehaviour. \\n\\nTo these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to \\nenter into a parley with them — in a word, to try them, and \\ntell me whether he thought they might be trusted or not to \\ngo on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the \\ninjury done him, of the condition they were brought to, and \\nthat though the governor had given them quarter for their \\nlives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to \\nEngland, they would all be hanged in chains ; but that if they \\nwould join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he \\nwould have the governor\\'s engagement for their pardon. \\n\\nAnyone may guess how readily such a proposal would be \\naccepted by men in their condition : they fell down on their \\nknees to the captain, and promised with the deepest impreca- \\ntions, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and \\nthat they should owe their lives to him, and would go with \\nhim all over the world ; that they would own him as a father \\nto them as long as they lived. \" Well,\" says the captain, \" I \\nmust go and tell the governor what you say, and see what I \\ncan do to bring him to consent to it.\" So he brought me an \\naccount of the temper he found them in, and that he verily \\nbelieved they would be faithful tt~..^- ,. ;hat we might be \\n\\n\\n\\n212 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nvery secure, I told liim he should go back again and choose \\nout those five, and tell them, that they might see he did not \\nwant men, that he would take out those five to be his assist- \\nants, and that the governor would keep the other two, and \\nthe three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as \\nhostages for the fidelity of those five ; and that if they proved \\nunfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should be hanged \\nin chains alive on the shore. This looked severe, and con- \\nvinced them that the governor was in earnest : however, they \\nhad no way left them but to accept it ; and it was now the \\nbusiness of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to per- \\nsuade the other five to do their duty. \\n\\nOur strength was now thus ordered for the expedition : \\nfirst, the captain, his mate, and passenger : second, then the \\ntwo prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their cha- \\nracter from the captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted \\nthem with arms : third, the other two that I had kept till now \\nin my bower pinioned, but, on the captain\\'s motion, had now \\nreleased: fourth, these five released at last; so that they \\nwere twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave \\nfor hostages. \\n\\nI asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these \\nhands on board the ship ; but as for me and my man Friday, \\nI did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men \\nleft behind ; and it was employment enough for us to keep \\nthem asunder, and supply them with victuals. As to the five \\nin the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Friday went in \\ntwice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries ; and I \\nmade the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, \\nwhere Friday was to take it. \\n\\nWhen I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the \\ncaptain, who told them I was the person the governor had \\nordered to look after them ; and that it was the governor\\'s \\npleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction ; \\nthat if they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and be \\nlaid in irons : so that as we never suffered them to see me as \\ngovernor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of \\nthe governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all \\noccasions. \\n\\nThe captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish \\nMs two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. lie \\n\\n\\n\\nKOBINSON CRUSOE. 213 \\n\\nmade his passenger captain of one, with four of the men ; and \\nhimself, his mate, and five more, went in the other ; and they \\ncontrived their business very well, for they came up to the \\nship about midnight. As soon as they came within call oi \\nthe ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they \\nhad brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long \\ntime before they had found them, and the like ; holding them \\nin a chat till they came to the ship\\'s side ; when the captain \\nand the mate entering first, with their arms, immediately \\nknocked down the second mate and carpenter with the butt- \\nend of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their \\nmen ; they secured all the rest that were upon the main and \\nquarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them \\ndown that were below ; when the other boat and their men, \\nentering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, \\nand the scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making \\nthree men they found there prisoners. When this was done, \\nand all safe upon deck, the captain or-dered the mate, with \\nthree men, to break into the round-house, where the new \\nrebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, \\nand with two men and a boy had got fire-arms in their hands; \\nand when the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new \\ncaptain and his men fired boldly among them, and wounded \\nthe mate with a musket-ball, which broke his arm, and \\nwotmded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The mate \\ncalling for help, rushed, however, into the round-house, \\nwounded as he was, and, Avith his pistol, shot the new captain \\nthrough the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came \\nout again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a \\nword more : upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was \\ntaken effectually, without any more lives lost. \\n\\nAs soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered \\nseven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon \\nwith me to give me notice of his success, which, you may be \\nsure, I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the \\nshore for it till near two o\\'clock in the morning. Having \\nthus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down ; and it havinr \\nbeen a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, 1i!l 1 \\nwas surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently starting \\nup, I heard a man call me by the name of \" Governor ! \\nGovernor !\" and presently I knew the captain\\'s voice ; when \\n\\n\\n\\n214 ItOBINSON C1LU50E. \\n\\nclimbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and, point- \\ning to the ship, he embiaced me in his arms. \" My dear \\nfriend and deliverer,\" says he, \" there\\'s your ship, for she is \\nall yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her.\" I cast \\nmy eyes to the ship, and there she rode, -within little more \\nthan half a mile of the shore ; for they had weighed her \\nanchor as soon as they were masters of her, and, the weather \\nbeing fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the \\nmouth of the little creek ; and, the tide being up, the captain \\nhad brought the pinnace in near the place where I at first \\nlanded my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at \\nfirst ready to sink down with the surprise; for I saw my \\ndeliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things \\neasy, and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I \\npleased to go. At first, for some time, I was not able to \\nanswer him one word ; but as he had taken me in his arms, \\nI held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. \\nHe perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle \\nout of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he \\n-had brought on purpose for me. After I had drank it, I sat \\ndown upon the ground ; and though it brought me to myself, \\nyet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him. \\nAll this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, \\nonly not under any surprise as I was ; and he said a thousand \\nkind, and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to \\nmyself: but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it \\nput all my spirits into confusion : at last it broke out into \\ntears ; and, in a little while after, I recovered my speech. I \\nthen took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and \\n•we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a \\nman sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole \\ntransaction seemed to be a chain of wonders. \\n\\nWhen we had talked a while, the captain told me he had \\nbrought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, \\nand such as the wretches that had been so long his masters \\nhad not plundered him of. Upon this, he called aloud to the \\nboat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for \\nthe governor ; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been \\none that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I \\nhad been to dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought \\nme a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters, sis large \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CliUSOE. 215 \\n\\nbottles of Madeira wine, two pounds of excellent good tobacco, \\ntwelve good pieces of the ship\\'s beef, and six pieces of pork, \\nwith a bag of pease, and about a hundredweight of biscuit ; \\nhe also brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full \\nof lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of \\nother things. But besides these, and what was a thousand \\ntimes more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, \\nsix very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, \\na hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit of \\nclothes of his own : in a word, he clothed me from head to \\nfoot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as anyone \\nmay imagine, to one in my circumstances ; but never was \\nanything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, \\nand uneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first. \\n\\nAfter these ceremonies were passed, nnd after all his good \\nthings were brought into my little apartment, we began to \\nconsult what was to be done with the prisoners we had. I \\ntold him that, if he desired it, I woidd undertake to bring \\nthe worst men he spoke of to make it their own request that \\nhe should leave them upon the island. \" I should be very \\nglad of that,\" says the captain, \" with all my heart.\" So I \\ncaused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now dis- \\ncharged, to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned \\nas they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came. \\nAfter some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit ; \\nand now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the \\ncaptain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, \\nand I told them I had got a full account of their villanous \\nbehaviour to the captain, but that Providence had ensnared \\nthem in their own ways, and that they had fallen into the pit \\nwhich they had dug for others. I let them know that by my \\ndirection the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the \\nroad ; and they might see, by-and-by, that their new captain \\nhad received the reward of his villany, and that they would \\nsee him hanging at the yard-arm ; that,\\' as to them, I wanted \\nto know what they had to say why I should not execute them \\nas pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they could \\nnot doubt but I had authority so to do. \\n\\nOne of them answered in the name of the rest, that they \\nhad nothing to say but this, that when they were taken, the \\ncaptain promised them their lives, and they humbly implored \\n\\n\\n\\n216 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nmy mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy to show \\nthem ; for as for myself, I had resolved to qviit the island \\nwith all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to \\ngo for England ; and, as for the captain, he could not carry \\nthem to England, other than as prisoners, in irons, to be \\ntried for mutiny, and running away with the ship ; the con- \\nsequence of which, they must needs know, would be the \\ngallows ; so that I could not tell what was best for them, \\nunless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If \\nthey desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, I had \\nsome inebriation to give them their lives if they thought \\nthey could shift on shore. They seemed very thankful for \\nit, and said they would much rather venture to stay there \\nthan be carried to England to be hanged. So I left it on that \\nissue. \\n\\nHowever, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, \\nas if he durst not leave them there. Upon this, I seemed a \\nlittle angry with the captain, and told him that they were my \\nprisoners, not his ; and. that seeing I had offered them so \\nmuch favour, I would be as good as my word ; and that if he \\ndid not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty \\nas I found them ; and if he did not like it, he might take them \\nagain if he could catch them. Upon this, they appeared \\nvery thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and \\nbade them retire into the woods, to the place whence they \\ncame, and I would leave them some fire-arms, some ammu- \\nnition, and some directions how they should live very well if \\nthey thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board the \\nship ; but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare \\nmy things, and desired him to go on board in the meantime, \\nand keep all right in the ship, and send the boat on shore \\nnext day for me ; ordering him, at all events, to cause the \\nnew captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, \\nthat these men might see him. \\n\\nWhen the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me \\nto my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with \\nthem on their circumstances. I told them I thought they \\nhad made a right choice ; that if the captain had carried them \\naway, they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the \\nnew captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told \\nthem they had nothing less to expect. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n217 \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen they had all declared their -willingness to stay, I \\nthen told them I would let them into the story of my living \\nthere, and put them into the way of making it easy to them. \\nAccordingly, I gave them the whole history of the place, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand of my coming to it ; showed them my fortifications, the \\nway I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes ; \\nand, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I \\ntold them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were \\nto be expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them pro- \\nmise to treat them in common with themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n218 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nI left them my fire-arms — viz., five muskets, three fowling- \\npieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half \\nof powder left. I gave them a description of the way I \\nmanaged the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, \\nand to make both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave \\nthem every part of my own story ; and told them I should \\nprevail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gun- \\npowder more, and some garden seeds, which I told them I \\nwould have been very glad of. Also, I gave them the bag of \\npease which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade \\nthem be sure to sow and increase them. \\n\\nHaving done all this, I left them the next day, and went \\non board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but \\ndid not weigh that night. The next morning early, two of \\nthe five men came swimming to the ship\\'s side, and, making \\nthe most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to \\nbe taken into the ship for God\\'s sake, for they should be mur- \\ndered, and begged the captain to take them on board, though \\nhe hanged them immediately. Upon this, the captain pre- \\ntended to have no power without me ; but, after some diffi- \\nculty, and after their solemn promises of amendment, they \\nwere taken on board, and were, some time after, soundly \\nwhipped and pickled ; after which they proved very honest \\nand quiet fellows. \\n\\nSome time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the \\ntide being up, with the things promised to the men ; to which \\nthe captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and \\nclothes to be added, which they took, and were very thank- \\nful for. I also encouraged them, by telling them, that if it \\nlay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I would \\nnot forget them. \\n\\nWhen I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for \\nrelics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, und \\none of my parrots ; also I forgot not to take the money I for- \\nmerly mentioned, as also the money I found in the wreck of \\nthe Spanish ship. And thus I left the island, the 19 th of \\nDecember, as I found by the ship\\'s account, in the year 1686, \\nafter I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months, \\nand nineteen days ; being delivered from this second captivity \\nthe same day of the month that I first made my escape ni the \\nloDg-boat, from among the Moors of Sallee. \\' In this vessel, \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 \\n\\nafter a long voyage, I arrived in England the 11th of June, \\nin the year 1687, having been thirty- five years absent. \\n\\nWhen I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all \\nthe -world as if I had never been known there. My bene- \\nfactor and faithful steward, whom I had left my money in \\ntrust with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in the \\nworld ; was become a widow the second time, and very low \\nin the world. I made her very easy as to what she owed me, \\nassuring her I would give her no trouble ; but, on the con- \\ntrary, in gratitude for her former care and faithfulness to me, \\nI relieved her as my little stock would afford; which at that \\ntime would, indeed, allow me to do but little : but I assured \\nher I would never forget her former kindness to me ; nor did \\nI forget her when I had sufficient, as shall be observed in its \\nproper place. I went down afterwards into Yorkshire ; but \\nmy father was dead, and my mother and all the family ex- \\ntinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children \\nof one of my brothers ; and as I had been long ago given \\nover for dead, there had been no provision made for me ; so \\nthat I found nothing to relieve or assist me ; and that the \\nlittle money I had would not do much for me as to settling \\nin the world. \\n\\nI met with one piece of gratitude, which I did not expect ; \\nand this was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so \\nhappily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship and \\ncargo, having given a very handsome account to the owners \\nof the manner how I had saved the lives of the men and the \\nship, they invited me to meet them and some other merchants \\nconcerned, and all together made me a very handsome com- \\npliment upon the subject, and a present of almost £200 \\nsterling. \\n\\nBut after making several reflections upon the circumstances \\nof my life, and how little way this would go towards settling \\nme in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might \\nnot come at some information of the state of my plantation in. \\nthe Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, who, I \\nhad reason to suppose, had some years past given me over for \\ndead. With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where I \\narrived in April following ; my man Friday accompanying \\nme very honestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most \\nfaithful servant. When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by \\n\\n\\n\\n220 ROBIXSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ninquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the \\ncaptain of the ship, who first took me up at sea off the shore \\nof Africa. He was now grown old, and had left off going to \\nsea, having put his son, who was far from a young man, into \\nhis ship, and who still used the Brazil trade. The old man \\ndid not know me; and indeed, I hardly knew him. But I \\nsoon brought him to my remembrance, and as soon brought \\nmyself to his remembrance, when I told him who I was. \\n\\nAfter some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance \\nbetween us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation \\nand my partner. The old man told me he had not been in \\nthe Brazils for about nine years ; but that he could assure me, \\nthat when he came away my partner was living ; but the \\ntrustees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of \\nmy part, were both dead : that, however, he believed I would \\nhave a very good account of the improvement of the planta- \\ntion ; for that, upon the general belief of my being cast away \\nand drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the \\nproduce of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, \\nwho had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, \\none-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of \\nSt. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, \\nand for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith : \\nbut that, if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the in- \\nheritance, it would be restored ; only that the improvement, \\nor annual production, being distributed to charitable uses, \\ncould not be restored : but he assured me that the steward \\nof the king\\'s revenue from lands, and the providore, or steward \\nof the monastery, had taken great care all along that my \\npartner gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of \\nwhieh they had duly received my moiety. I asked him if he \\nknew to what height of improvement he had brought the \\nplantation, and whether he thought it might be worth looking \\nafter ; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with \\nany obstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety. \\nHe told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the \\nplantation was improved ; but this he knew, that my partner \\nwas grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it ; \\nand that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that \\nthe king\\'s third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away \\nto some other monastery or religious house, amounted to \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 221 \\n\\nabove two hundred moidores a year : that as to my being \\nrestored to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to \\nbe made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title, \\nand my name being also enrolled in the register of the \\ncountry; also he told me that the survivors of my two \\ntrustees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy; \\nand he believed I would not only have their assistance for \\nputting me in possession, but would find a very considerable \\nsum of money in their hands for my account, being the pro- \\nduce of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before \\nit was given up, as above ; which, as he remembered, was for \\nabout twelve years. \\n\\nI showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this \\naccount, and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass \\nthat the trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when he \\nknew that I had made my will, and had made him, the \\nPortuguese captain, my universal heir, &c. \\n\\nHe told me that was true ; but that as there was no proof \\nof my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some \\ncertain account should come of my death ; and, besides, he \\nwas not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote : that \\nit was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim; \\nand could he have given any account of my being dead or \\nalive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken posses- \\nsion of the ingenio (so they call the sugar-house), and have \\ngiven his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it. \\n\" But,\" says the old man, \" I have one piece of news to tell \\nyou, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the \\nrest ; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the world \\nbelieving so also, your partner and trustees did offer to \\naccount with me, in your name, for the first six or eight \\nyears\\' profits, which I received. There being at that time \\ngreat disbursements for increasing the works, building an \\ningenio. and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much \\nas afterwards it produced : however,\" says the old man, \" I \\nshall give you a true account of what I have received in all, \\nand how I have disposed of it.\" \\n\\nAfter a few days\\' farther conference with this ancient friend, \\nhe brought me an account of the first six years\\' income of \\nmy plantation, signed by my partner and the merchant- \\ntrustees, being always delivered in goods ; and I found by \\n\\n\\n\\n222 E0BIX30X CRUSOE. \\n\\nthis account, that every year the income considerably in- \\ncreased; hut the disbursements being large, the sum at first \\nwas small : however, the old man let me see that he was \\ndebtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, \\nbesides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of to- \\nbacco, which were lost in his ship : he having been ship- \\nwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my \\nleaving the place. The good man then began to complain of \\nhis misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of \\nmy money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new \\nship. \"However, my old friend,\" says he, \"you shall not \\nwant a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son \\nreturns, you shall be fully satisfied.\" Upon this he pulls out \\nan old pouch, and gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal \\nmoidores in gold ; and giving the writings of his title to the \\nship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he \\nwas quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts them \\nboth into my hands for security of the rest. \\n\\nI was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of \\nthe poor man to be able to bear this ; and remembering what \\nhe had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how \\ngenerously he had used me on all occasions, and particularly \\nhow sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain \\nweeping at what he had said to me ; therefore I asked him if \\nhis circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at \\nthat time, and if it would not straiten him ? He told me he \\ncould not say but it might straiten him a little ; but, however, \\nit was my money, and I might want it more than he. \\n\\nEverything the good man said was full of affection, and I \\ncould hardly refrain from tears while he spoke ; in short, I \\ntook one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and \\nink to give him a receipt for them ; then I returned him the \\nrest, and told him if ever I had possession of the plantation \\nI would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I afterwards \\ndid) ; and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son\\'s \\nship, I would not take it by any means ; but that if I wanted \\nthe money, I found he was honest enough to pay me ; and if \\nI did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to \\nexpect, I would never have a penny more from him. \\n\\nWhen this was passed, the old man asked me if he should \\nput me into a method to make my claim to mv r>lant; tion. \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 223 \\n\\nI told him I thought to go over to it myself. He said I might \\ndo so if I pleased ; but that, if I did not, there were ways \\nenough to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate \\nthe profits to my use ; and as there were ships in the river of \\nLisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my \\nname in a public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon \\noath, that I was alive, and that I was the same person who \\ntook up the land for the planting the said plantation at first. \\nThis being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration \\naffixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter of his writing, \\nto a merchant of his acquaintance at the place ; and then \\nproposed my staying with him till an account came of the \\nreturn. \\n\\nNever was anything more honourable than the proceedings \\nupon this procuration ; for in less than seven months I re- \\nceived a large packet from the survitors of my trustees, the \\nmerchants, for whose account I went to sea, in which were \\nthe following particular letters and papers enclosed. \\n\\nFirst, there was the account-current of the produce of my \\nplantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced \\nwith my old Portugal captain, being for six years ; the \\nbalance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and \\nseventy-four moidores in my favour. \\n\\nSecondly, there was the account of four years more, while \\nthey kept the effects in their hands, before the government \\nclaimed the administration, as being the effects of a person \\nnot to be found, which they called civil death ; and the \\nbalance of this, the value of the plantation increasing, \\namounted to about three thousand two hundred and forty \\nmoidores. \\n\\nThirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine\\'s account, \\nwho had received the profits for above fourteen years ; but \\nnot being to account for what was disposed of by the hospital, \\nvery honestly declared he had eight hundred and seventy- \\ntwo moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my \\naccount : as to the king\\'s part, that refunded nothing. \\n\\nThere was a letter of my partner\\'s, congratulating me very \\naffectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how \\nthe estate was improved, and what it produced a year; with \\nthe particulars of the number of acres that it contained, how \\nplanted, how many slaves there were upon it ; and making \\n\\n\\n\\n224 KOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\ntwo-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so \\nmany Ave Marias to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was \\nalive ; inviting me very passionately to come over and take \\npossession of my own; and, in the meantime, to give him \\norders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not \\ncome myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friend- \\nship, and that of his family ; and sent me, as a presi/nt, seven \\nfine leopards\\' skins, which he had, it seems, received from \\nAfrica, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and \\nwhich, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent \\nme also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, ana a hundred \\npieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By \\nthe same fleet, my two merchant-trustees shipped me one \\nthousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls ot \\ntobacco, and the rest of the whole account in gold. \\n\\nI might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job \\nwas better than the beginning. It is impossible to express \\nthe flutterings of my very heart when I found all my wealth \\nabout me ; for as the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same \\nships which brought my letters brought my goods : and the \\neffects were safe in the river before my letters came to my \\nhand. \\n\\nI was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand \\npounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well \\ncall it, in the Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as \\nsure as an estate in England : and, in a word, I was in a con- \\ndition which I scarce knew how to understand, or how to \\ncompose myself for the enjoyment of it. The first thing I \\ndid was to recompense my origina benefactor, my good old \\ncaptain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress, \\nkind to me in ray beginning, and honest to me at the end. \\nI showed him all that was sent to me ; I told him that, next \\nto the providence of Heaven, which disposed all things, it was \\nowing to him ; and that it now lay on me to reward him, \\nwhich I would do a hundredfold : so I first returned to him \\nthe hundred moidores I had received of him ; then I sent for \\na notary, and caused him to draw up a general release from \\nthe four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had ac- \\nknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner \\npossible. After which, I caused a procuration to be drawn, \\nempowering him t-j be the receiver of the annual profits of \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n225 \\n\\n\\n\\nmy plantation; and appointing my partner to account with \\nhim, and make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my \\nname ; and by a clause in the end, made a grant of one hun- \\ndred moidores a year to him during his life, out of the effects, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life : \\nand thus I requited my old man. \\n\\nI had now to consider which way to steer my course next, \\nand what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put \\ninto my hands : and indeed, I had more care upon my head \\nnow than I had in ray. silent state of life in the island, whers \\n\\n\\n\\n226 ItOBINSON CKUSOE. \\n\\nI wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what \\nI wanted ; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and \\nmy business was how to secure it. I had not a cave now to \\nhide my money in, or a place where it might lie without lock \\nor key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before anybody \\nwould meddle with it ; on the contrary, I knew not where to \\nput it, or whom to trust with it. My old patron, the captain, \\nindeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I had. In \\nthe next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon \\nme thither ; but now I could not tell how to think of going \\nthither till I had settled my affairs, and left my effects in \\nsome safe hands behind me. At first I thought of my old \\nfriend the widow, Avho I knew was honest, and would be just \\nto me ; but then she was in years, and but poor, and, for \\naught I knew, might be in debt ; so that, in a word, I had no \\nway but to go back to England myself, and take my effects \\nwith me. \\n\\nIt was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; \\nand, therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and \\nto his satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so I \\nbegan to think of the poor widow, whose husband had been \\nmy first benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my \\nfaithful steward and instructor. So, the first thing I did, I \\ngot a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in \\nLondon, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry \\nher, in money, a hundred pounds from me, and to talk with \\nher, and conribrt her in her poverty, by telling her she should, \\nif I lived, have a farther supply : at the same time, I sent \\nmy two. sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they \\nbeing, though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances ; \\none hawing been married and left a widow ; and the other \\nhaving a husband not so kind to her as he should be. But, \\namong all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet \\npitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my \\nstock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and leave things \\nsafe behind me ; and this greatly perplexed me. \\n\\nI had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have \\nsettled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the \\nplace ; but I had some little scruple in my mind about reli- \\ngion, . which insensibly drew me back. However, it was \\nnot religion that kept me from going there for the present; \\n\\n\\n\\nEOBIXSOX CRUSOE. 227 \\n\\nbut that really I did not know with whom to leave my effects \\nbehind me ; so I resolved at last to go to England, where, it \\nI arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaintance, or \\nfind some relations, that would be faithful to me ; and, \\naccordingly, I prepared to go to England with all my wealth. \\n\\nIn order to prepare things for my going home, I first re- \\nsolved to give answers suitable to the just and faithful account \\nof things I had from thence ; and, first, to the Prior of St. \\nAugustine, I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings, \\nand the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores \\nwhich were undisposed of, which. I desired might be given, \\nfive hundred to the monastery, and three hundred and \\nseventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct; desiring \\nthe good padre\\'s prayers for me, and the like. I wrote next \\na letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the acknow- \\nledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as for \\nsending them any present, they were far above having any \\noccasion for it. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledg- \\ning his industry in improving the plantation, and his integrity \\nin increasing the stock of the works ; giving him instructions \\nfor his future government of my part, according to the powers \\nI had left with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send \\nwhatever became due to me, till he should hear from me \\nmore particularly ; assuring him that it was my intention not \\nonly to come to him, but to settle myself there for the re- \\nmainder of my life. To this I added a very handsome pre- \\nsent of some Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for \\nsuch the captain\\'s son informed me he had ; with two pieces \\n<>f fine English broad cloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, \\nfive pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good \\nvalue. \\n\\nHaving thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and \\nturned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next \\ndifficult}- was which way to go to England : I had been \\naccustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange \\naversion to go to England by sea at that time ; and though \\nI could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased \\nupon me so much, that though I had once shipped mv \\nbaggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind two or three \\ntimes. \\n\\nIt is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this \\n\\n\\n\\n228 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nmight be one of the reasons ; but let no man slight the \\nstrong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such mo- \\nment : two of the ships which I had singled out to go in, \\nhaving put my things on board one of them, and in the other \\nto have agreed with the captain, miscarried, one was taken by \\nthe Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start, near \\nTorbay, and all the people drowned, except three ; so that \\nin either of those vessels I had been made miserable. \\n\\nHaving been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, \\nto whom I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly \\nnot to go by sea, but either to go by land to the Groyne, and \\ncross over the Bay of Biscay to Kochelle, from whence it \\nwas but an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so \\nto Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the \\n■way by land through France. In a word, I was so prepos- \\nsessed against my going by sea at all, except from Calais to \\nDover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land ; which, \\nas I was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by \\nmuch the pleasanter way : and to make it more so, my old \\ncaptain brought an English gentleman, the son of a mer- \\nchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me ; after \\nwhich we picked up tw r o more English merchants also, and \\ntwo young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris \\nonly ; so that, in all, there were six of us, and five servants ; \\nand as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as \\na servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much a \\nstranger to be capable of supplying the place of a servant on \\nthe road. \\n\\nIn this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our company \\nbeing very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop, \\nwhereof they did me the honour to call me captain, as well \\nbecause I was the oldest man, as because I had two ser- \\nvants, and, indee.d, was the origin of the whole journey. \\n\\nAs I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so \\nI shall trouble you now with none of my land journal ; but \\nsome adventures that happened to us in this tedious and \\ndifficult journey I must not omit. \\n\\nWhen we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to \\nSpain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of \\nSpain, and what was worth observing; but, it being the \\n\\nlatter part of the summer, we luistpnorl n-w-m. anc l se (; 0U ( \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 229 \\n\\nfrom Madrid about the middle of October ; but when we \\ncame to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several \\ntowns on the way, with an account that so much snow was \\nfallen on the French side of the mountains, that several \\ntravellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after \\nhaving attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on. \\n\\nWhen we came to Pampeluna itself, Ave found it so indeed ; \\nand to me, that had always been used to a hot climate, and to \\ncountries where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold \\nwas insufferable : nor. indeed, was it more painful than sur- \\nprising, to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where \\nthe weather was not only warm, but very hot, and imme- \\ndiately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains so very \\nkeen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to en- \\ndanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes. \\n\\nPoor Friday was really frightened when he saw the moun- \\ntains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which \\nhe had never seen or felt before in his life. To mend the \\nmatter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued snowing \\nwith so much violence and so long, that the people said winter \\nwas come before its time ; and the roads, which were difficult \\nbefore, were now quite impassable ; for the snow lay in some \\nplaces too thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, \\nas is the case in the northern countries, there was no goino- \\nwithout being in danger of being buried alive every step. \\nWe stayed no less than twenty days at Pampeluna ; when \\n(seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being \\nbetter, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had \\nbeen known in the memory of man), I proposed that we \\nshould go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for \\nBordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while I was \\nconsidering this, there came in four French gentlemen, who, \\nhaving been stopped on the French side of the passes, as we \\nwere on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing \\nthe country near the head of Languedoc, bad brought them \\nover the mountains by such ways that they were not much \\nincommoded with the snow ; for where they met with snow \\nin any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear \\nthem and their horses. We sent for this guide, who told us \\nhe would undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard \\nfrom the snow, provided we w«rp o.rrved sufficiently to pro- \\n\\n\\n\\n230 ItOBINSON CKUSOE. \\n\\ntect ourselves from wild beasts : for, lie said, in these great \\nsnows, it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at \\nthe foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of \\nfood, the ground being covered with snow. \"We told him we \\nwere well enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if \\nhe would ensure us from a kind of two-legged wolves, which, \\nwe are told, we were in most danger from, especially on the \\nFrench side of the mountains. He satisfied us that there \\nwas no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go ; \\nso we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other \\ngentlemen, with their servants, some French, some Spanish, \\nwho, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come \\nback again. \\n\\nAccordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide, \\non the loth of November ; and I was surprised, when, in- \\nstead of going forward, he came directly back with us on the \\nsame road that we came from Madrid, about twenty miles ; \\nwhen, having passed two rivers, and come into the plain \\ncountry, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where \\nthe country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen ; but, on a \\nsudden, turning to his left, he approached the mountains an- \\nother way ; and though it is true the hills and precipices \\nlooked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders, \\nand led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed \\nthe height of the mountains without being much encumbered \\nwith the snow ; and, all on a sudden, he showed us the \\npleasant and fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony. \\nall green and flourishing, though, indeed, at a great distance, \\nand we had some rough way to pass still. \\n\\nWe were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed \\none whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel ; \\nbut he bid us be easy ; we should soon be past it all ; we \\nfound, indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to \\ncome more north than before ; and so, depending upon our \\nguide, we went on. \\n\\nIt was about two hours before night, when, our guide being \\nsomething before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three \\nmonstrous wolves, and after them a bear, from a hollow way \\nadjoining to a thick wood : two of the wolves made at the \\nguide, and, had he been far before us, he would have been \\ndevoured- haftvro wp r-nnld lia-c-o l-ielnorl liim • one f them \\n\\n\\n\\nKOmXSON CRUSOE. 231 \\n\\nfastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with \\nsuch violence, that he had not time or presence of mind \\nenough to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us \\nmost lustily. My man Friday being next to me, I bade him \\nride up, and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday \\ncame in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the \\noilier, \\'\\' master ! O master \\'.\" but, like a bold fellow, rode \\ndirectly up to the poor man, and with his pistol shot the \\n■Wolf that attacked him in the head. \\n\\nIt was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ; \\nfor, having been used to such creatures in his country, he had \\nno fear upon him, but went close up to him and shot him ; \\nwhereas any other of lis would have fired at a farther dis- \\ntance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered \\nshooting the man. \\n\\nBut it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I ; \\nand, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise, \\nof Friday\\'s pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal \\nhowling of wolves ; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of \\nthe mountains, appeared to us as if there had been a pro- \\ndigious number of them ; and perhaps there was not such a \\nfew as that we had no cause of apprehension : however, as \\nFriday had killed this wolf* the other that had fastened upon \\nthe horse left him immediately, and fled, without doing him \\nany damage, having happily fastened upon his head, where \\nthe bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth. But the man \\nwas most hurt : for the raging creature had bit him twice, \\nonce in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee ; \\nand though he had made some defence, he was just tumbling \\ndown by the disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and \\nshot the wolf. \\n\\nIt is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday\\'s pistol we \\nall mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which \\nwas very difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the \\nmatter. As soon as we came clear of the trees, which \\nblinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the case, and \\n7 ;ow Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did \\nnot presently discern what kind of creature it was he had \\nkilled. \\n\\nBut never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such - \\nsurprising manner, as that which follower! between Friday \\n\\n\\n\\n232 ROBIXSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nand the bear, which gave us all, though at first we were sur- \\nprised and afraid for him, the greatest diversion imaginable. \\nAs the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop \\nas the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two par- \\nticular qualities, which generally are the ride of his actions : \\nfirst, as to men, who are not his proper prey, if you do not \\nmeddle with him, he will not meddle with you ; but then you \\nmust take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, \\nfor he is a very nice gentleman ; he will not go a step out of \\nhis way for a prince ; nay, if you are really afraid, your best \\nway is to look another way and keep going on ; for some- \\ntimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, \\nhe takes it for an affront ; but if you throw or toss anything \\nat him, and it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as \\nbig as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all \\nother business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have \\nsatisfaction in point of honour ; — this is his first quality : the \\nnext is, if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night \\nor day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good round \\nrate until he overtakes you. \\n\\nMy man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we \\ncame up to him, he was helping him off his horse, for the \\nman was both hurt and frightened, when on a sudden we \\nespied the bear come out of the wood, and a monstrous one \\nit was, the biggest by far that I ever saw. We were all a \\nlittle surprised when we saw him ; but when Friday saw him, \\nit was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow\\'s countenance : \\n\" 0, O, !\" says Friday, three times, pointing to him : \\'\\' O \\nmaster ! you give me te leave, me shakee te hand with him ; \\njne makee you good laugh.\" \\n\\nI was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased : \\' : You \\nfool,\" says I, \" he will eat you up.\" \" Eatee me up ! eatee \\nme up !\" says Friday, twice over again ; \" me eatee him up ; \\nme make you good laugh ; you all stay here, me show you \\ngood laugh.\" So down he sits, and gets off his boots in a \\nmoment and puts on a pair of pumps, gives my other ser- \\nvant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the \\nwind. \\n\\nThe bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with \\nnobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the \\nbear could understand him, \" Hark ye, hark ye,\" says Friday, \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSO N CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n29 f \\n\\n\\n\\n\" me speakee with you.\" We followed at a distance, for now \\nbeing come down on the Oascony side of the mountains, we \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwere entered a vast forest, where tlio country was plain and \\npretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here \\nand there. FrMnv WT,« fc»J - -- _ 7j the heels of the \\n\\n\\n\\n234 \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nsear, came up with him quickly, and took up a great stone, \\nind threw it at him, and hit him just on the head, but did \\naim no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall ; \\nbut it answered Friday\\'s end, for the rogue was so void of \\ntear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him, and \\nshow us some laugh, as he called it. As soon as the bear felt \\nthe blow, and saw him, he turns about, and comes after lnm, \\ntaking very long strides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, as \\nwould have put a horse to a middling gallop : away runs \\nFriday, and takes his course as if he ran towards us for help ; \\nso we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver \\nmy man ; though I was angry at him heartily for bringing \\nthe bear back upon us, when he was going about his own \\nbusiness another way : and especially I was angry that he had \\nturned the bear upon us, and then run away ; and I called out, \\n;t You dog! is this your making us laugh? Come away, and take \\nyour horse, that we may shoot the creature.\" He heard me, \\nmd cried out, \" No shoot, no shoot ; stand still, and you get \\nmuch laugh :\" and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the \\nbear\\'s one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and see- \\ning a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned us to \\nfollow ; and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree, \\nlaying his gun down upon the ground, at about five or six \\nyards from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to \\nthe tree, and we followed at a distance : the first thing he did, \\nlie stopped at the gun, smelled at it, but let it he, and up he \\nscrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous \\nheasry. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, \\nand could not for my life see anything to laugh at yet, till \\nseeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him. \\n\\nWhen we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the \\nsmall end of a large branch, and the bea>r got about half Avay \\nto him. As soon as the bear got out to that part where the \\nlimb of the tree was weaker, — \" Ha !\" says he to us, \" now \\nyou see me teach ee the beai dance:\" so he began jumping \\nand shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but \\nstood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he \\nshould get back ; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But \\nFriday had not done with him by a great deal: when seeing \\nhim stand still, he called out to him again, as if he had supposed \\nthe bear could speak English, \" What, you come no farther? \\n\\n\\n\\nKOBIXSON CRUSOE. 235 \\n\\npray you come farther ;\" so lie left jumping and shaking the \\ntree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, \\ndid come a little farther ; then he began jumping again, and \\nthe bear stopped again. We thought now was a good time \\nto knock him in the head, and called to Friday to stand still, \\nand we would shoot the bear : but lie cried out earnestly, \\n\" pray, pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then:\" he \\nwould have said by-and-by. However, to shorten the story, \\nFriday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that \\nwe had lausrhins; cnousrh, but still could not imagine what the \\nfellow would do : for the first we thought he depended upon \\nshaking the bear off; and we found the bear was too cunning \\nfor that too ; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown \\ndown, but clung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so \\nthat we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and \\nwhat the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of \\ndoubt quickly : for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, \\nand that he would not be persuaded to come any farther, \\n\" Well, well,\" says Friday, \" you no come farther, me go ; \\nyou no come to me, me come to you ;\" and upon this he \\nwent to the smaller end of the bough, where it would bend \\nwith his weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding \\ndown the bough till he came near enough to jump down on \\nhis feet, and away he ran to his gun and took it up. \" Well, 1 \\' \\nsaid I to him, \" Friday, what will you do now ? Why don\\'t \\nyou shoot him ?\" \" No shoot,\" says Friday, \" no yet ; me \\nshoot now, me no kill ; me stay, give you one more laugh :\" \\nand, indeed, so he did ; for when his enemy saw he was gone, \\nhe came back from the bough where he stood, but did it very \\ncautiously, looking behind him every step, and coming back- \\nward till he got into the body of the tree ; then, with the \\nsame hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping \\nit with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very \\nleisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his \\nhind foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, \\nclapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him \\ndead. Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not \\nlaugh ; and when he saw we were pleased, by our looks, he \\nbegan to laugh very loud. \" So we kill bear in my country,\" \\nSays Friday. \" So you kill them ?\" says I ; \" why, you have \\nno guns.\" \" No,\" says he, \" no gun, but shoot great much \\n\\n\\n\\n236 \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\nlong arrow.\" This was a good diversion to us ; but wo were \\nstill in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what \\nto do we hardly knew; the howling of wolves ran much in \\nmy head ; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the \\nshore of Africa, I never heard anything that filled me with \\nso much horror. \\n\\nThese things, and the approach of night, called us off, or \\nelse, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have \\ntaken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was \\nworth saving; but we had near three leagues to go, and \\nour guide hastened us ; so we left him, and went forward on \\nour journey. \\n\\nThe ground was still covered with snow, though not so \\ndeep and dangerous as on the mountains ; and the ravenous \\ncreatures, as we \\'heard afterwards, were come down into the \\nforest and plain country, pressed by hunger to seek for food, \\nand had done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where \\nthey surprised the country people, killed a great many of their \\nsheep and horses, and some people too. We had one dan- \\ngerous place to pass, and our guide told us, if there were more \\nwolves in the country we should find them there ; and this \\nwas a small plain surrounded with woods on every side, and a \\nlong narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get \\nthrough the wood, and then we should come to the village \\nwhere we were to lodge. It was within half an hour of sun- \\nset when we entered the wood, and a little after sunset when \\nwe came into the plain : we met with nothing in the first \\nwood, except that in a little plain within the wood, which was \\nnot above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross \\nthe road, full speed, one after another, as if they had been \\nin chase of some prey, and had it in view ; they took no notice \\nof us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon \\nthis, our guide, who by the way was but a faint-hearted \\nfellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed there \\nwere more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready, and \\nour eyes about us ; but we saw no more wolves till we came \\nthrough that wood, which was near half a league, and entered \\nthe plain. As soon as we came into the plain, we had occa- \\nsion enough to look about us : the first object we met with \\nwas a horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen \\nof them at work, we could not say eating him, but picking his \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CKUSOE. 237 \\n\\nbones rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before. We \\ndid not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither did \\nthey take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at \\nthem, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found \\nwe were like to have more business upon our hands than we \\nwere aware of. We had not gone half over the plain, when \\nwe began to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in \\na frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a hundred \\ncoming on directly towards us, all in a body, and most of \\nthem in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up by expe- \\nrienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to receive \\nthem, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only \\nway ; so we formed in a moment : but that we might not have \\ntoo much interval, I ordered that only every other man should \\nlire, and that the others, who had not fired, should stand \\nready to give them a second volley immediately, if they con- \\ntinued to advance upon us ; and then that those who had fired \\nat first, should not pretend to load their fusees again, but stand \\nready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a \\nfusee and a pair of pistols each man ; so we were, by this \\nmethod, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time : however, \\nat present we had no necessity ; for, upon firing the first \\nvolley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with \\nthe noise as with the fire ; four of them being shot in the head, \\ndropped: several others were wounded, and went bleeding \\noff, as we could see by the snow. I found they stopped, but \\ndid not immediately retreat ; whereupon, remembering that I \\nhad been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the \\nvoice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as loud as \\nwe could ; and I found the notion not altogether mistaken ; \\nfor upon our shout they began to retire and turn about. I \\nthen ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear, which \\nput them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods. \\nThis gave us leisure to charge our pieces again ; and that we \\nmight lose no time, we kept going ; but Ave had but little \\nmore than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, \\nwhen we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left, \\nonly that it was farther onward, the same way we were to go. \\nThe night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, \\nwhich made it worse on our side ; but the noise increasing, we \\ncould easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those \\n\\n\\n\\n238 nouixsox cuusor.. \\n\\nhellish creatures ; and on a sudden we perceived two or three \\ntroops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one in \\nour front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them : \\nhowever, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way \\nforward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which was \\nonly a good hard trot. In this manner, we came in view of \\nthe entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at \\nthe farther side of the plain ; but we were greatly surprised. \\nwhen coming nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number \\nof wolves standing just at the entrance. On a sudden, at \\nanother opening of the wood, we heard the noise of a gun, \\nand looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and \\na bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seven- \\nteen wolves after him full speed : the horse had the advan- \\ntage of them ; but as we supposed that he could not hold it \\nat that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him \\nat last : no question but they did. \\n\\nBut here we had a most horrible sight ; for riding up to \\nthe entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses \\nof another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous \\ncreatures ; and one of the men was no doubt the same whom \\nwe heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired \\noff; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his \\nbody were eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew \\nnot what course to take ; but the creatures resolved us soon, \\nfor they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey ; and i \\nverily believe there were three hundred of them. It happened, \\nvery much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the \\nwood, but a little way from it, there lay some large timber \\ntrees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I sup- \\npose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among \\nthose trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long \\ntree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before \\nus for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, in- \\nclosing our horses in the centre. Wc did so, and it was well \\nwe did ; for never was a more furious charge than the crea- \\ntures made upon us in this place. They came on with a growl- \\ning kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as \\nI said, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon \\ntheir prey ; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally \\noccasioned by their seeing our horses behind us I ordered our \\n\\n\\n\\nROBIXSON CRUSOE. Zot? \\n\\nmen to fire as before, every other man; and they took ther \\naim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at the first \\nvolley ; but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing-, for \\nthey came on like devils, those behind pushing on those before. \\n\\nWhen we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought \\nthey stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, \\nbut it was but a moment, for others came forward again ; \\nso we fired two volleys of our pistols ; and I believe in these \\nfour firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and \\nlamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loath to- \\nspend our shot too hastily ; so I called my servant, not my \\nman Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest \\ndexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own \\nwhile we were engaged, — but, as I said, I called my other man, \\nand giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all \\nalong the piece of timber, and let it be a large train. He did \\nso, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came \\nup to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged \\npistol close to the powder, set it on fire ; those that were upon \\nthe timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell,, \\nor rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the \\nfire: we despatched these in an instant, and the rest were so \\nfrightened with the light, which the night — for it was now \\nvery near dark — made more terrible, that they drew back t \\nlittle ; upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in \\none volley, and after that we gave a shout ; upon this the \\nwolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near \\ntwenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and \\nfell to cutting them with our swords, which answered our ex- \\npectation, for the crying and howling they made was better \\nunderstood by their fellows ; so that thev all fled and left us. \\n\\nWe had, first and last, killed about tnreo-score of them, and \\nliad it been daylight we had killed many more. The field of \\nbattle being thus cleared, we came forward again, for we had \\nstill near a league to go. We heard the ravenous creatures \\nhowl and yell in the woods as we went several times, and some- \\ntimes wo fancied we saw some of them ; but the snow dazzling- \\nour eyes, we were not certain. In about an hour more wo \\ncame to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in. \\na terrible fright, and all in arms; for, it seems, the night before \\nthe wolves and some bears had broke into the village, and put \\n\\n\\n\\n■ft \\n\\n\\n\\n24.0 K01JINS0N CKUSOE. \\n\\nthem in such terror, that they were obliged to keep guard night \\nand day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, \\nand indeed their people. \\n\\nThe next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled \\nso much with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go \\nno farther; so we were obliged to take a new guide here, and \\ngo to Thoulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, \\npleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like \\nthem ; but when we told our story at Thoulouse, they told us \\nit was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at \\nthe foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay on the \\nground ; but they inquired much what kind of a guide we had \\not, who would venture to bring us that way in such a severe \\nseason, and told us it was surprising we were not all devoured. \\n\"When we told them how we placed ourselves and the horses \\nIn the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was \\nfifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was the sight \\nof the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their \\nprey, and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun ; \\nbut being excessively hungry, and raging on that account, the \\neagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of \\ndanger, and that if we had not by the continued fire, and at \\nlast by the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, \\nit had been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces; \\nwhereas, had we been content to have sat still on horseback, \\nand fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses \\nso much for their own, when men were on their backs, as \\notherwise; and, withal, they told us that at last, if we had \\nstood all together, and left our horse?, they would have been \\nso eager to have devoured them, that we might have come off \\nsafe, especially having our firearms in our hands, and being \\nso many in number. For my part, I was never so sensible of \\ndanger in my life, for, seeing above three hundred devils \\ncome roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having \\nnothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost ; \\nand, as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those \\nmountains again ; I think I would much rather go a thousand \\nleagues by sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once \\nii week. \\n\\nI have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage \\nthrough Fiance — nothing but what other travellers have given \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\n\\n\\n241 \\n\\n\\n\\nan account of with much more advantage than I can. I tra- \\nvelled from Thoulouse to Paris, and without any considerable \\nstay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover the 14th of \\nJanuary, after having a severe cold season to travel in. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a \\nlittle time all my new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills \\nof exchange which I brought with me having been very cur- \\nrently paid. \\n\\nMy principal guide and privy-counsellor was mv good, \\n16 \\n\\n\\n\\n242 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent \\nher, thought no pains too much nor care too great to employ \\nfor me ; and I trusted her so entirely with everything, that I \\nwas perfectly easy as to the security of my effects ; and, in- \\ndeed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now to the \\nend, in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman. \\n\\nAnd now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in \\nthe Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who having \\noffered it to the two merchants^, the survivors of my trustees, \\nwho lived in the Brazils, they accepted the offer, and remitted \\nthirty-three thousand pieces-of-eight to a correspondent of \\ntheirs at Lisbon to pay for it. \\n\\nIn return, I signed the instrument, of sale in the form which \\nthey sent from Lisbon, tand sent it to -my old man, who sent \\nme the bills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hun- \\ndred pieces-of-eight for the estate, reserving the payment of \\none hundred moidores .a . year to him (the old man) during his \\nlife, and fifty msidores afterwards to Ms son for his life, whieh \\nI had promised theavand which the plantation was to make \\ngood as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first part \\nof a life of fortune and adventure—*! life of Providence\\'s \\nchequer-work, and of a variety which the world will seldom \\nbe able to show the like of- — beginning foolishly, but closing \\nmuoh more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so \\nmuch as to hope for. \\n\\nAny one would think that in this state of complicated good \\nfortune I was past running any more hazards, and so, indeed, \\nI had been, if other circumstances had concurred ; but I was \\ninured to a wandering life, had no family, nor many relations ; \\nnor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance ; and \\nthough I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not \\nkeep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be \\nupon the wing again ; especially I could not resist the strong \\ninclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor \\nSpaniards were in being there. My true friend, the widow, \\nearnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me, \\nthat for almost seven years she prevented my running abroad, \\nduring which time I took my two nephews, the children of one \\nof my brothers, into my care : the eldest having something of \\nhis own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a setltenient \\nof some addition to his estate after my decease. The other I \\n\\n\\n\\nROBINSON CRUSOE. 243 \\n\\nplaced with the captain of a ship ; and after five years, find- \\ning him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him \\ninto a good ship, and sent him to sea ; and this young fellow \\nafterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther adventures \\nmyself. \\n\\nIn the mean time I in part settled myself here ; for, first of \\n■all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dis- \\nsatisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one \\ndaughter ; but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home \\nwith good success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to \\ngo abroad and his importunity prevailed, and engaged me to \\ngo in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies ; this was \\nin the year 1694. \\n\\nIn this voyage I visited my new colony in the island — saw \\nmy successors the Spaniards — had the whole story of their \\nlives, and of the villains I left there — how at first they insulted \\nthe poor Spaniards — how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, \\nunited, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged \\nto use violence with them — how they were subjected to the \\nSpaniards — how honestly the Spaniards used them ; a history, \\nif it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful acci- \\ndents as my own part, particularly, also, as to their battles \\nwith the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the \\nisland, and as to the improvement they made upon the island \\nitself, and how five of them made an attempt upon the main- \\nland, and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners, \\nby which, at my coming, I found about twenty young children \\non the island. \\n\\nHere I stayed about twenty days — left them supplies of all \\nnecessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, \\nclothes, tools, and two workmen, which I brought from Eng- \\nland with me, viz., a carpenter and a smith. \\n\\nBesides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, re- \\nserved to myself the property of the whole, but gave them \\nsuch parts respectively as they agreed on ; and having settled \\nall things with them, and engaged them not to leave the \\nplace, I left them there. \\n\\nFrom thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent \\na bark, which I bought there, with more people to the island ; \\nand in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being \\nsuch as I found proper for service, or for wives to such as \\n\\n\\n\\n244 ROBINSON CRUSOE. \\n\\nwould take thorn. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to \\nsend them some women from England, with a good cargo of \\nnecessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting, which \\nI afterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very \\nhonest and diligent after they were mastered, and had their \\nproperties set apart for them. I sent them, also, from the \\nBrazils five cows, three of them being big with calf, some \\nsheep, and some hogs, which when I came again were con^ \\nsiderably increased. \\n\\nBut all these things, with an account how three hundred \\nCaribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their planta- \\ntions, and how they fought with that whole number twice, and \\nwere at first defeated, and one of them killed ; but, at last, a \\nstorm destroying their enemies\\' canoes, they famished or \\ndestroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the \\npossession of their plantation, and still lived upon the island. \\n\\nAll these things, with some very surprising incidents in \\nsome new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall \\ngive a farther account of in the second part of ray history. \\n\\n\\n\\nPART II. \\n\\n', False, True]"
